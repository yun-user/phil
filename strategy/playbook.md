# Strategy Playbook

AGENT-EDITABLE. This file is mine (the trading agent's) to rewrite as I learn.
Every edit must be justified by evidence from settled positions (see
`journal/retros/`). Version: v0 — seeded by the operator, unproven.

**How to read this file (DEEP-2026-09-30).** It is ~450KB / 7,100 lines,
and a default Read returns only the first 2,000 lines. Anything below
line 2,000 is invisible unless you page to it. That includes every
ruling added since mid-August. Each FULL cycle: run `grep -n '^## '
strategy/playbook.md` for the section map, then read the sections that
match the candidates in hand, plus every `DEEP-*` rulings section from
the last 7 days. Those sit at the end of the file. Settled narrative
lives in `strategy/playbook-archive.md`. You do not need to read it
per cycle.

**Before committing a FULL cycle (DEEP-2026-10-01):** `tail -1
strategy/funnel.jsonl` must show this cycle's timestamp. Three FULL
cycles in three days committed 300 screener rows and no funnel row
(41b031e, d43503c, f3bf184). The third one placed a bet.

## Thesis

I cannot out-research the market on everything. I can win where (a) the market
is thin or inattentive, and (b) public information is retrievable in minutes.
Short-term markets force fast feedback: every settled bet is a data point on
where my research actually beats the price.

### Edge classes (added DEEP-2026-07-31, from the 2/2 vs 0/7 split)

Rank every candidate by WHY the market should be wrong, strongest first:

1. **Structural — information race**: the resolution-relevant fact is already
   public and the book demonstrably hasn't finished repricing (verify at the
   live book, not the mid). Evidence: `2dc417ed68f6` won.
   **Multi-source verification standard (DEEP-2026-08-12, enacting the
   DEEP-2026-08-02 pre-registration now that both pair legs have settled
   lost — `b21e42c123a1` 2026-08-04, `d2dd24206542` 2026-08-12):** "the fact
   is already public" requires at least one non-party primary source (wire
   service Reuters/AP/AFP, host-government official statement, or the
   resolver's own named source) — a consensus composed entirely of state
   media of the parties to the event (PressTV, Mehr, TASS, Xinhua on the
   Iran-vs-Gulf-states claims) does not qualify on its own, however many
   outlets repeat it or how internally consistent they are. This is now a
   general condition of the class, not just the spread-rule exception
   below (which already applied a narrower version of this to
   `b21e42c123a1` alone, DEEP-2026-08-05). Both pair legs lost on
   state-media-only corroboration of a contested Iran-conflict claim: the
   reporting was plausible and mutually consistent, and the resolver still
   read the fact the opposite way on both legs.
   **Fact-finality requirement (DEEP-2026-08-03):** the fact must be FINAL
   as the resolver will see it — an official print/close/result — not an
   estimate subject to scheduled revision, whenever the bet's margin sits
   inside typical revision noise. Sunday box-office numbers are studio/
   Comscore estimates revised by Monday actuals; `84ec821167d5` bet No at
   0.16 on a "$2M short" (0.6%) margin from such an estimate and was
   marked to ~0.02 within 10h as actuals landed. N outlets repeating one
   provisional figure are ONE source, not N confirmations. Corollary: a
   liquid book holding its price AFTER your headlines are public — or
   moving further against you while you check — is the crowd pricing
   something beyond the headline (revision risk, resolver read), not the
   crowd being slow; the NG win (`2dc417ed68f6`) was the opposite shape,
   an already-final official settlement print.
   **Bracket-sibling verification / immediate-post-release-book trap
   (2026-09-11, RETRO-20260911-1244):** for a bracket-set market (CPI/PPI/
   GDP style, multiple binary legs on one release), once
   `umaResolutionStatus` moves to `"proposed"` on the legs, checking the
   sibling brackets directly by market ID is a cheap, sharp way to pin the
   exact print — sharper than a calendar aggregator and available before a
   primary-source page catches up (a clean bracket set has exactly one leg
   near 1.0 and the rest near 0; if two adjacent legs are both elevated at
   once, the set hasn't settled yet). The corollary this cycle had to learn
   the hard way: an immediate post-release CLOB read, taken before that
   proposed-resolution convergence, is NOT settlement corroboration — a
   2026-09-11 cycle cited "the core-MoM-0.2 book moved to bid 0.72/ask
   0.92" as market-side confirmation the Aug core CPI print was 0.2%; the
   actual BLS print was 0.3%, the 0.2% leg fully reversed to ~0 within
   the hour, and only the "treat as provisional" hedge already attached to
   that note stopped the wrong figure from grading 11 open forecasts
   against the wrong number. Don't cite "the market confirms X" for an
   exact numeric print off an early, still-moving read — wait for a
   proposed/clean-single-winner bracket set or a primary-source fetch.
2. **Structural — cross-market inconsistency**: two related markets (sibling
   1X2 legs, spread-vs-ML) imply contradictory probabilities. Evidence:
   `1e8dec1078ba` won.
   **Validity test (DEEP-2026-08-03):** the sibling's implied probability
   must be actually INCOMPATIBLE with the target market's — work the
   implication out numerically before citing it. A bracket market whose
   range contains the target's threshold discriminates nothing:
   `84ec821167d5` cited the $350-360M bracket (~85% Yes) as contradicting
   beat-record-$357.1M (~84% Yes), but $357.1M is inside the bracket, so
   those prices are perfectly consistent (crowd centered ~$357-360M).
   The claimed inconsistency was an inference error, not a signal.
   **Sensing (DEEP-2026-08-05, integrating operator-notes.md §1):** finding
   siblings used to be opportunistic (only noticed when a candidate happened
   to be part of an obviously-bracketed cluster). `strategy/tools/siblings.py
   <market_id>` fetches every sibling market on the same Polymarket event in
   one call (gamma `/markets?id=` exposes an `events[0].id`, and
   `/events/<id>` returns all markets on it with live prices — verified live
   2026-08-05, a soccer exact-score event returned 17 siblings) and prints a
   `_sum_check` of their Yes prices. For a genuinely mutually-exclusive,
   fully-covering set this should sum to ~1.0 (+vig); a sum far off is a
   candidate worth the numeric-implication check above. Run it on any
   candidate whose question implies siblings exist (brackets, exact-score,
   winner-of-N, spread-vs-ML pairs) as a normal part of research.
   **Caveat found on first live use:** the test event's 17 sum-checked to
   4.24, not ~1 — but every individual price sat in a narrow 0.23-0.26 band
   regardless of how plausible the score (0-0 same price as 3-3), and each
   market's `liquidityNum` was ~$100. That is untraded/placeholder resting
   prices, not a mispriced market — nobody would leave a real 4x-overround
   arb sitting there. **Always check book depth/spread (existing `max_spread`
   veto) before treating a sum-check deviation as a signal**; a sum-check
   flag on a thin book is a data-quality tell, not an edge.
   **Coverage is per EVENT (2026-09-19 00:0xZ):** run the census BEFORE the
   first web search on a bracketed candidate, and read `my_open_forecasts`
   on every sibling. Evidence: the BanRep September event was researched
   twice in 8 hours (hold rung 55fa44583b8b at 16:25Z, +50bp rung
   668cd9a0adc6 at 00:00Z, same sources, same read) because the coverage
   check asked only whether the pool's market id had a forecast. A sibling
   with an open forecast under ~6h old and no new fact means the new rung
   is recorded from that research, not re-researched.
   **Sibling-group census (DEEP-2026-08-22): the "question implies
   siblings" trigger is not enough — make the census standing.** Zero
   cross-market candidates entered the funnel between ~Aug 12 and Aug 22
   while cross-market is the ONLY real-eligible edge class
   (config/protected.json real.allowed_edge_classes) and one of the two
   classes with settled wins (`1e8dec1078ba`; the CPI-cluster arithmetic
   of Aug 11-12). The trigger fires only when a researcher happens to
   pick up a bracket-shaped question — a structurally invisible channel
   whenever research minutes go elsewhere, which is exactly what the
   window audits keep showing. Scan output has carried `event_id` since
   2026-08-05 (operator instrument change) precisely to make this cheap:
   **every FULL cycle's scan step groups the scan output by `event_id`,
   counts groups with 2+ admissible markets, and logs `sibling_groups: N`
   (with the top group's event_id and liquidity) in the funnel line.**
   When N>0 and no higher-priority research exists (mechanical-econ due,
   watch-item trigger fired), spend one research slot on the
   highest-liquidity group's consistency arithmetic (siblings.py for live
   prices, then the numeric-implication test above, book-depth caveat
   included). This is a counting rule, not a betting rule — the point is
   that the one class real execution can act on stops being invisible to
   selection grading.
3. **Book-devig arbitration** (weakest): "my devig of scraped bookmaker odds
   beats the PM price" on a liquid market. A 1-cent-spread PM book with real
   depth is made by someone pricing off the same feeds, live — this class is
   a head-to-head contest with a sharper counterparty and went **0/7 on
   2026-07-30/31** (`1436bb727464`, `8e67cf4882bc`, `83ef29ef9493`,
   `4d5a4304a4d0`, `3cce11272d9d`, `1399450675ba`, `2c4c6a2adc0a`;
   P(0/7 | own ests) ≈ 1%). It requires `risk.json min_edge_book_devig`
   (0.07), not the base `min_edge`, and a power devig (see Estimation).
   Confirmed 2026-07-31/08-01 at zero cost: ~12 clean benchmarks devigged
   across MLB/WNBA/soccer, every tight PM book matched the devigged line
   within 1-2 cents (cycle logs 17:11Z–02:12Z).
   **Post-power-devig record (DEEP-2026-08-06): 2W/0L** — `509650e5ec31`
   (edge 0.10) and `2363018c118b` (edge 0.0795, Blue Jays +1.5), both
   power-devigged single-book lines against tight 0.01-spread PM books,
   both clearing the 0.07 floor with margin. The 0/7 above was the
   proportional-devig era; n=2 since the fix is far from a verdict, but
   the class is no longer zero-for-everything. The 0.07 floor also became
   BINDING for the first time this window (~10 clean devig edges
   0.003–0.050 skipped, funnel.jsonl 2026-08-05/06, largest A's/Reds
   0.050) — its cost is now measured in skipped candidates instead of
   hypothetical. Unchanged at n=2; the blocked 0.02–0.05 band on tight
   MLB books is exactly the sharp-counterparty zone the 0/7 came from.

   **Recreational/political bookmaker tables are a weaker counterparty
   than sports sharp books — don't treat them as the same evidence tier
   (2026-09-17, `b063db346052` settled LOST).** The sports-book-devig
   record above (2W/0L post-fix) is built on liquid, continuously-updated
   sharp books (MLB/soccer/WNBA feeds via `core/odds.py`). The Liberals
   entry instead devigged "ten Swedish bookmakers over/under 4.0" scraped
   via WebSearch — the rationale itself flagged this table as undated and
   the books as recreational (8pct overround) before betting. Settlement
   confirms the flagged risk: PM had already repriced 0.375→0.50 on Sep 4
   in anticipation of the Novus 4.3 poll (confirmed by the outcome — L
   cleared decisively at 5.40%), while the scraped book table and the
   devig built on it lagged that move. A book-devig edge on an election/
   political market needs either a dated, refreshable book source (not a
   one-off WebSearch scrape) or an explicit check for recent poll-driven
   PM moves the books haven't caught up to yet; absent both, treat the
   edge as sports-book-devig treats a stale line (§thin-or-stale-book
   caution above), not as a clean sharp-book read. n=1 for this specific
   failure mode — a caution to weigh at entry, not yet a ban.

Info-race status (updated DEEP-2026-08-12): the class is **2W/4L by
decision** — wins on mechanical/final facts (`2dc417ed68f6` official
print, `1e8dec1078ba` cross-market), losses on provisional or
interpretation-dependent ones (ai-leaderboard pair as one decision,
`84ec821167d5`, `b21e42c123a1` settled LOST -$5 on 2026-08-04 via a normal
UMA flow: est 0.90 on state-media-sourced claims, resolver waited out the
market's 3-day conflicting-reports clause and resolved No, and now
`d2dd24206542`, the sibling leg, settled LOST -$5 on 2026-08-12 — 12 days
past end date with no UMA proposal ever submitted, book decayed to
bid/ask 0.001/0.002 and never recovered). Both legs of the
DEEP-2026-08-02 pre-registered pair are now settled losses: the rule is
**enacted**, not a caution — see the multi-source verification standard
under edge class 1 above. Net effect of this one Iran-conflict pair on
the info-race record: -$10, 2 of the 4 losses.

**Ledger edge_class split (DEEP-2026-08-26): `fact-final` is its own
class.** The 2W/4L info-race record above splits exactly on
fact-finality (wins on already-final mechanical facts, losses on
provisional/interpretation-dependent ones), and the operator's
architectural ruling (operator-notes 2026-08-05 ~19:45Z) draws the same
line: fact-final reads — "official numbers the market hasn't priced
correctly" — are what this architecture is built for, while racing a
reprice is not. 2026-08-26 04:27Z produced the clean prototype:
`5fbf676cfd7f`, $5 Diamondbacks ML @0.138 on a game already Final
(ARI 5-4, MLB Stats API gamePk 825042, independently re-verified by
DEEP-2026-08-26 against the market slug `mlb-chc-ari-2026-08-25`) with
the book still pricing Cubs 0.866. Rule for future bets: when the
resolving fact is ALREADY IMMUTABLE at bet time (official print
published, game over, vote counted — only resolver deviation can lose),
record ledger `edge_class` **`fact-final`**; **`info-race`** keeps only
pre-final shapes (scheduled-but-unhappened events like the GTA VI
trailer `c6f16acc55d9`, running counts, announced-not-confirmed facts).
The two open 2026-08-25/26 rows are ledger-frozen as `info-race` (only
core writes the ledger); retros grade `5fbf676cfd7f` under fact-final
manually. score.py's by-class table picks the split up automatically as
labeled rows settle. If fact-final reaches n>=5 settled with the record
the operator's note predicts, a proposal to add it to
`real.allowed_edge_classes` is warranted; not before.

**First settlement (RETRO-20260826-0818): `5fbf676cfd7f` WON, +$31.23**,
brier_delta -0.7421 — no resolver deviation, official box score matched the
already-final fact at bet time. **fact-final running total: n=1, 1W/0L,
+$31.23.** 1 of the 5 settlements needed before the `real.allowed_edge_classes`
proposal is warranted. The wide-book
exception (§Spread-rule scope) reads on both labels wherever it says
"info-race class" — its tightened condition (1) (fact FINAL/MECHANICAL)
is definitionally satisfied by fact-final and remains the binding test
for info-race proper.

**Liquid-book credibility rule (pre-registered on `c6f16acc55d9`
DEEP-2026-08-26, trigger fired 2026-08-28 06:xx Z cycle):** the fork's
"premiere airs unlabeled" branch occurred. Rockstar's Aug 27 premiere
aired as "Grand Theft Auto VI: An Extended Look" (official Newswire and
YouTube title, a 26-minute gameplay presentation), while market 2732505
requires content "clearly labelled and marketed as a trailer" — the
liquid book ($23.6k), which had refused to converge toward the est-0.90
read for two weeks, now prices Yes 0.069 vs the 0.36 entry (MTM ~-$4).
The market was never inattentive; it was pricing resolution-criteria
risk the research treated as noise. RULE, effective now: **an info-race
rationale claiming "the market hasn't noticed X" is credible only on a
thin or stale book.** On a LIQUID book (roughly, liquidity >= $10k or
spread <= 0.02 with real depth) that has not converged after an
apparently-known catalyst, the presumption reverses: the market is
pricing a criteria/eligibility risk the research missed. Before betting
such a book, the rationale must (i) quote the exact resolution wording,
(ii) name the specific non-obvious reading the market is discounting,
and (iii) say why that discount is wrong — "they haven't seen the news"
is not admissible for liquid books on scheduled catalysts. Two
independent evidence lines: this row (liquid-book analog of
`b21e42c123a1`, the criteria-risk loss class), and the BoK live-CLOB
convergence observation (§BoK grading notes: on scheduled announcements
the CLOB is structurally faster than WebSearch indexing, so quote the
book before claiming an info edge). Ledger grading of `c6f16acc55d9`
itself still happens at settlement (Sep 1; a labeled trailer by Aug 31
would flip it, market says ~7%).

**Sharpened DEEP-2026-08-28 — the rule binds BETS, not just claims:**
for ANY bet on a book with liquidity >= $10k, the ledger rationale MUST
quote the decisive resolution clause(s) verbatim, whatever the edge
class or rationale shape. Evidence: `bbe450e04eb9` (Lake America No
@0.668, $58.8k book) was placed hours after this rule landed with a
sound mechanical-timeline thesis but WITHOUT quoting the market text —
which contains a dual-label clause ("both 'Lake America' and 'Lake
Ontario'" = YES) and a credible-reporting alternative source, both of
which fatten the Yes tail the est-0.96 never priced. The bet stands
(the 4-day GNIS timeline still favors No decisively) but the estimate
was overconfident by exactly the unread-clause tail — the recurring
z≈−3 signature. A liquid-book bet whose rationale lacks the clause
quote is a discipline violation from this point on.

**Fact-finality gate on large info-race edges (DEEP-2026-08-30):** a
claimed edge > 0.10 can pass the outside-view veto ONLY on (i) a fact
already IMMUTABLE at bet time — fact-final: official print published,
game over, vote counted, only resolver deviation can lose — or (ii) a
cross-market arithmetic inconsistency computable from live books. A
documented-but-unfinished process (an EO clock, an agency workflow, a
rollout precedent, a scheduled-but-unhappened event) is a timeline
FORECAST, not a fact, however good the paper trail: the market can read
the same documents, and est-vs-price disagreement above 0.10 on a
liquid book reverts to the veto exactly like a self-model. Quoting the
resolution clause and then dismissing it with an unsourced assumption
(6f7dfb5b7c0c: "dual-label still needs the GNIS step first") satisfies
the documentation rule while repeating the error — the gate closes that
path. Evidence, all settled: >0.10-claimed-edge bets now 0W/7L −$35
(7e753de88823, 0bf9fe3785c6, b21e42c123a1, 84ec821167d5, d6d71ab454dc,
bbe450e04eb9, 6f7dfb5b7c0c — the last two the Lake America pair,
edge 0.292/0.44, settled LOST 2026-08-30 06:14Z); info-race 2W/4L split
exactly on fact-finality (wins 1e8dec1078ba, 2dc417ed68f6 both
final/mechanical; all four losses provisional/interpretive) — the Lake
pair is counted separately above pending a consistent recount of the
narrative info-race tally; fact-final 1W/0L +$31.23 (5fbf676cfd7f).
**Reaffirmed at settlement (2026-08-30 06:14Z):** both Lake America legs
settled LOST — bbe450e04eb9 (Aug31, No @0.668, est 0.96) and 6f7dfb5b7c0c
(Sep4, No @0.38, est 0.82) — the rename completed inside the GNIS clock
the thesis relied on as a floor, confirming both were timeline forecasts,
not facts. The gate stands unchanged. The gate would
have blocked both Lake America legs and the GTA VI bet while touching
neither structural win, the fact-final prototype, nor any ≤0.10 bet. The
mechanical-econ carve-out is unaffected (its band is 0.10–0.20 against a
QUOTED external benchmark — condition (ii)-like, and separately gated).

**Gate's founding evidence set CLOSED (RETRO-20260901-0639, GTA VI
settled 2026-09-01):** `c6f16acc55d9` (Yes @0.36, est 0.90) LOST — the
Aug27 premiere aired unlabeled ("An Extended Look," not a trailer) exactly
as the liquid-book fork anticipated. All three founding bets are now
**3 settled-lost out of 3, zero reconsideration triggers**:
Lake America ×2 + GTA VI. Running >0.10-claimed-edge bet tally: **0W/8L
−$40** (adds GTA VI's −$5 to the prior 7e753de88823/0bf9fe3785c6/
b21e42c123a1/84ec821167d5/d6d71ab454dc/bbe450e04eb9/6f7dfb5b7c0c list).
No further grading duty attaches to this gate's founding set; future
>0.10-edge liquid-book bets extend the tally but don't reopen this
evidence review.

**Clause-to-outcome mapping (2026-09-07 17:58Z, `0ed1d77858d7` open,
enacted outcome-independent):** condition (i) is satisfied only when the
immutable fact MAPS to the outcome under the clause as written, and the
map has to be shown, not asserted. Required in the rationale of any bet
whose thesis is "fact plus calendar" or "fact plus rule": (a) the
concrete sequence of events by which the OTHER side resolves, and (b)
why the clause's own timing closes that sequence. The market's end date
is not the resolution horizon unless the clause says so; windows,
clocks and grace periods defined in the description govern. Evidence:
the Iran ceasefire No bet (est 0.93 @0.54, claimed edge 0.39, class
info-race) quoted the operative sentence ("resolves Yes if any such
period is completed where the most recent qualifying military action
occurred on or before the specified end date") and read it as "the
window must close by the end date." It means the reverse: the last
strike must fall on or before the end date, and the 14-day window may
complete after it (through 12:00 ET Sep 15 from the Sep 1 strike). The
Yes path was open the whole time, the market priced it (0.54 No at
entry, 0.42 No on deadline day), and eight checkpoints re-confirmed the
fact without re-reading the clause. Superseded to No 0.40, no edge
(`1063bcaec323`). Same family as the Lake America dual-label miss: the
DEEP-2026-08-30 quote rule was satisfied and the error survived it.
This paragraph closes that path: a quoted clause with no (a)/(b) mapping
is a documentation violation, and a fact that needs a window to run
past the end date to be decisive is a timeline forecast under the gate,
not a fact. Grading duty: when `0ed1d77858d7` settles, the info-race
tally gets a note that this row was a clause-mapping error, not a
fact-quality error (RETRO-20260907-1758 §2).

NOT an edge class — **resolver-interpretation reads** (graded
DEEP-2026-08-01): "I checked the exact resolution source and it says X"
where the reading requires a judgment call (UI toggle, table choice, which
mirror). The ai-leaderboard pair (`7e753de88823`+`0bf9fe3785c6`, one
decision, -$10) lost while the operator verified the named source three
times over 22h — including after resolution — and it never moved
(journal/operator-notes.md). The fact was right; the resolution process
read it differently. Treat these below book-devig; the §Estimation
resolver-process red-flag rule applies.

## Fit rubric (DEEP-2026-08-05, operator mandate: selection is a learned
competency and was ungraded)

Estimation is measured to death (brier_delta by category/edge class); WHICH
markets I choose to spend research budget on was not measured at all — a
0-for-N day could mean "no edge existed" or "edge existed, wrong candidates
picked" or "queries built the wrong pool", and nothing distinguished them.
Score every candidate that reaches research (not just ones I bet on) against
five properties, derived from the settled record (2W/3L info-race split by
fact-finality; the Blue Jays book-devig win; the $20k-econ-vs-$400k-tennis
asymmetry):

1. **Mechanical resolution** — official print/close/countable metric/
   arithmetic, not a narrative or judgment call. (Y/N)
2. **Benchmark reachable** — open API, WebSearch-dense coverage, or
   Polymarket-internal arithmetic (siblings), confirmed reachable THIS cycle,
   not assumed. (Y/N)
3. **Edge persistence hours-to-days** — if the thesis would decay in minutes
   (a repricing race), score N; this architecture's unit of action is a
   multi-minute research session and cannot win a speed race (operator-notes
   2026-08-05 ~19:45Z). (Y/N)
4. **Bounded resolution tail** — no open-ended dispute/UMA risk of the kind
   that locked `d2dd24206542` 5+ days past end date. (Y/N)
5. **Research cost small relative to payout** — thin-liquidity/high-effort
   candidates (a $20-1000 China-CPI bracket needing a scrape) score N even if
   1-4 pass.

Fit score = count of Y (0-5). Candidates scoring ≤2 are exploration-budget
territory (see below), not default research targets. Log the score inline
with the skip/bet reason per candidate (funnel instrumentation below) — this
is what lets a deep retro grade selection the way `core/score.py` grades
estimates: which properties actually produced settled edge per research-hour.

**Same-day index/ETF direction, first instance (2026-08-10):** SPX/SPY
"up or down today" markets (resolve on official close vs prior close,
same-day) score N on property 3 — a directional call with ~100min to
resolution is a reaction-speed contest on the world's most liquid feed, the
same architecture problem operator-notes 2026-08-05 ruled out for info-race.
A naive Brownian-bridge model (vol scaled by sqrt(session-time-remaining))
claimed a large edge (SPX Down priced 0.78-0.805 ask vs model ~0.57-0.59) —
exactly the "large claimed edge in an efficient market" shape that's 0W/5L
elsewhere in the record; treat any such reading as a modeling gap, not
alpha, and decline regardless of size. Recorded as forecasts
(skip-reason `architecture-mismatch`) for calibration only, not researched
as bet candidates going forward absent a property-3 change.
Threshold-close variants ("SPY closes above $X on <date>") are the same
family and take the same label. RETRO-20260917-2050: forecast
`ddab4cfd4c5b` (SPY > $765 on Sep 17, settled No) was filed `no-edge` in
category `commodities`, and its note quoted the screener's stale mid
(0.095) while the record-time book was 0.14/0.15 - against the live book
the same 0.09 estimate read as a 0.05 No-side "edge" on a $683 book, the
exact shape this rule declines. Label these `architecture-mismatch` /
`commodities-touch` like the Sep 4 row `d810e5c5d49f`, and quote the
record-time bid/ask in the note, never the screener mid.

## Funnel instrumentation (DEEP-2026-08-05, operator mandate)

Selection was ungraded because nothing recorded the funnel between "scan
pool" and "bet placed" — cycle logs only ever showed the researched subset,
never what was skipped or why. Every FULL cycle, append one JSON line to
`strategy/funnel.jsonl` (strategy-owned, not the ledger) with:
`{"cycle": "<UTC ISO>", "strategy_rev": "<short sha>", "pool_by_query":
{"<discovery.py _label>": <n>}, "researched": [{"market_id": "<id>",
"category": "<cat>", "fit_score": <0-5>, "skip_reason":
"no-edge|benchmark-unreachable|ambiguous-resolution|budget-exhausted|
market-agrees|bet-placed"}]}`. This is additive to the cycle-log prose, not
a replacement — the prose stays for narrative context, the JSONL is what a
deep retro scripts against to grade selection quantitatively (e.g. which
fit-score bucket produced the settled wins). Skip reasons must be the actual
reason, not padded — a "market-agrees" skip on something that later moved
20 points is a selection error, and only shows up in a retro if the original
call is on record.

**Skip-reason taxonomy rule (DEEP-2026-08-11):** `outside-view-veto` may
appear in a funnel row ONLY when a forecast row exists for that
market+outcome (link its forecast_id) — the veto blocks *bets*, never
*estimates*; a vetoed candidate by definition had a concrete estimate,
and unrecorded vetoed estimates are exactly what makes the veto
unfalsifiable. When research concluded no honest independent estimate
could be formed (contradictory sources, interpretive-inference-only,
no credible poll), the skip reason is `benchmark-unreachable`, whatever
made research stop — the estimate-bearing/estimate-free line is what the
coverage audit reconciles against forecasts.jsonl. Evidence of the blur
this fixes: MN-Gov (2026-08-10 04:16Z) and SC round-1 (07:33Z) both
logged `outside-view-veto` with no forecast (estimate never formed),
while SC round-1 (14:39Z) logged the same reason WITH forecasts — same
label, opposite auditability. Also: every researched funnel entry
carries its forecast_id(s) inline (the 2026-08-11 02:21Z entry omitted
them; coverage was verified clean, but only by market_id
reconciliation, which does not scale).

**Same-commit rule (DEEP-2026-09-13): the funnel line ships with the
cycle commit.** A FULL cycle's commit that appends no `strategy/funnel.jsonl`
line is a violation on its face, exactly like a veto settlement without its
CF-table row (2026-08-23 rule) — "the prose stays for narrative context"
was never license to let the prose replace the JSONL. Evidence: 7 of the 9
FULL cycles between DEEP-2026-09-12 and DEEP-2026-09-13 (10:18Z through
04:20Z) wrote rich funnel *prose* in cycles.log and zero funnel lines —
the 10:18Z cycle alone researched 5 candidates to concrete estimates and
recorded 5 forecasts, none of it machine-readable. All 7 were backfilled
by DEEP-2026-09-13 (flagged `"backfill"` in the lines; pool_by_query lost
for 6 of them because prose only kept totals). A cycle that researched
nothing still writes the line with `"researched": []` — an empty window on
record is selection data; a missing line is indistinguishable from a
skipped duty. If a third window shows the same drift after this rule,
propose a mechanical CI-side check (cycle-log FULL line count vs funnel
line count) instead of more prose.

**Taxonomy addition (DEEP-2026-08-13): `category-bar`.** A decline whose
operative reason is a playbook category bar (contested primaries; the
general-election extension below) uses skip reason `category-bar`, not
`outside-view-veto` — the veto is specifically the >0.10-claimed-edge
numeric boundary, and its settled record (6-for-6 pre-registered, n=3
officially settled at brier_delta +0.1109) is only interpretable if the
label stays coextensive with the definition. Evidence of the blur this
fixes: fa185b55a5c3 (Zambia, 2026-08-13 04:18Z) logged `outside-view-veto`
"by extension" at claimed edge ~0.05 — a principled decline under the
election bar, but under the wrong label; at settlement it would pollute
the veto slice with a row the veto never fired on. Same forecast-row
requirement as the veto: an estimate was formed, so a forecast row is
mandatory and its forecast_id goes in the funnel line.

**Taxonomy addition (DEEP-2026-08-14): `wide-spread-veto`.** A decline
whose operative reason is the max_spread rule (book spread > 0.06 blocks
the bet regardless of apparent edge) uses skip reason `wide-spread-veto`,
not `outside-view-veto`. Evidence this split is load-bearing, not
pedantry: of the 8 settled rows labeled `outside-view-veto`, the 5
self-generated-model rows (SC Fry, MN Craig/Flanagan, Musk 120-139 and
140-159) settled at mean dBrier **+0.118 — market better on every row**,
while the 3 wide-spread rows (PPI 5.3%/5.4%/≥6.0%, mechanical base-effect
model, ids 5ad483698a95/169b4fd6c04a/4908388c9fd7) settled at mean dBrier
**-0.010 — agent better on every row**. One label was averaging two
mechanisms with opposite settled signs, which corrupts both instruments:
the veto's "N-for-N" record only means something over rows where the veto
actually fired on estimate quality, and the spread rule's *cost* (edges
foregone to illiquidity, which the PPI rows show can be real) is invisible
unless its rows are separable. Same forecast-row requirement as the other
estimate-bearing labels. When both apply (self-model edge AND wide book),
use `outside-view-veto` — estimate distrust dominates, since the estimate
would be blocked at any spread.

**Taxonomy extension (RETRO-20260908-1612): `no-edge` vs
`wide-spread-veto`.** The DEEP-2026-08-14 rule above ruled on
`outside-view-veto` vs `wide-spread-veto` and never said what `no-edge`
may not be used for, so the third leg leaked. Rule: **`no-edge` means the
EDGE ITSELF failed to clear the floor.** If the edge cleared the floor
and only `max_spread` blocked the bet, the label is `wide-spread-veto` -
even when the ask-side edge looks marginal, and even when the wide book
is what made the nominal edge look small in the first place. Same
forecast-row requirement as the other estimate-bearing labels.

Evidence, and the erratum it forces. Forecast `96065826ed50`
(2026-09-08 08:22Z, Go Ahead Eagles resumed-match win, est 0.91 vs mid
0.7555, ask 0.869, spread 0.227) was recorded `no-edge` while its own
note read "nominal ask-edge 0.041 clears min_edge (0.04) but the spread
(0.227) is far over max_spread (0.06) ... no bet, spread veto binds."
It settled LOST at dBrier **+0.2573**. `forecasts.jsonl` is core-written
and cannot be corrected in place, so **reclassify this row by hand
before reading either slice**:

- `no-edge` (n=307, printed +0.0009, aggregate ≈ +0.276) carries
  +0.2573 of its total in this ONE row. Drop it and the remaining 306
  rows sum to ~+0.02, a mean on the order of +0.0001 - flat. Robust to
  the printed rounding (remaining mean lands in +0.00001..+0.0001
  either way). The clean-feed-null instrument has no drift; it has one
  mislabelled row.
- `wide-spread-veto` (n=4, −0.0553, "agent better on every row" per
  DEEP-2026-08-20) becomes n=5 at ≈ **+0.0072** - neutral, not
  uniformly agent-better. This row is the spread rule's first settled
  instance of the veto SAVING money rather than costing it, and the
  mislabel is what hid it.

One label averaging two mechanisms with opposite settled signs corrupts
both instruments - the same argument DEEP-2026-08-14 made, recurring a
month later at ~5x the per-row magnitude. That is why this is a rule and
not a note.

**Taxonomy addition (DEEP-2026-08-25): `census-consistent`.** A sibling-
census or cross-market consistency check that finds no signal (ladder
monotonic, 1X2 sum ≈ 1, no arb) and forms NO independent probability
estimate must not be labeled `no-edge` — `no-edge` is estimate-bearing
and reconcile.py check 2 rightly demands a forecast_id for it. Use
`census-consistent` (estimate-free, like `benchmark-unreachable`).
Evidence: the 2026-08-25T04:13:41Z funnel line logged the Valencia/Betis
census check as `no-edge` with the note "no independent estimate formed
so no forecast row" — reconcile FAILed on it at the 2026-08-25 deep
retro; two identical mislabels on the 2026-08-22T20:11:00Z line had
already aged out of the check window unflagged. All three relabeled in
place (funnel is agent instrumentation with backfill precedent,
DEEP-2026-08-24). The distinction is load-bearing for the same reason as
every other taxonomy split here: `no-edge` rows are the clean-feed
calibration stream; census rows silently mixed in would dilute it with
entries that never had an estimate at all.

**Taxonomy clarification (DEEP-2026-08-15): blanket category bars at
sub-boundary edges.** When a category carries a blanket self-model bar
(contested primaries/elections; social-media-postcount) and a leg's
claimed edge is ≤0.10, the decline's operative reason is the bar, not the
numeric veto — label it `category-bar`. `outside-view-veto` stays
coextensive with the >0.10 boundary (DEEP-2026-08-13), otherwise the
veto's settled ledger accumulates rows the veto never fired on. Instance
that prompted this: the 2026-08-15 04:18Z Musk weekly set labeled all 5
legs `outside-view-veto` though three (70331099597c, c24926a5c9d7,
7808b6f5a4ef, claimed edges 0.025-0.045) were sub-boundary. Recorded rows
are immutable (core writes forecasts.jsonl), so the reading rule: at
settlement those three rows grade the bootstrap model, NOT the veto —
exclude them from any veto-record claim.

**Coverage weld (DEEP-2026-08-20): recording forecasts and writing the
funnel line are ONE act, same commit.** A FULL cycle that records any
forecast MUST append its funnel line before committing — a forecast
whose cycle has no funnel entry is unauditable for selection by
construction (no pool counts, no fit scores, no skip reasons for the
non-forecast declines). Evidence: the 2026-08-19 18:20Z cycle researched
6 clean-feed candidates, recorded 6 forecasts and spent 4 odds-api
credits, and wrote no funnel line at all — the window's largest research
batch has no selection record, and the 3 line-mismatch skips from that
cycle survive only as prose. Third funnel-coverage defect in three
windows (schema drift 3-of-7 on 2026-08-18; omission here); the next
one is a compliance pattern, not an oversight.

**Weld escalated to a mechanical check (DEEP-2026-08-21).** The declared
"next one" happened twice on the weld's first day in force: the
2026-08-20 14:27Z (Toulouse/Lyon, e5d0e44532c3 + 9a1c771fd651) and
18:17Z (MLB h2h, 371aa91ed8bc + 84e1b257aa68) FULL cycles both recorded
forecasts with no funnel line — five coverage defects in five windows.
Prose rules have demonstrably not held, so the check is now code:
**before the commit of any FULL cycle that recorded a forecast, run
`python3 strategy/tools/reconcile.py` (24h window) and it must print OK.**
It verifies both directions: every recent forecast id appears in a funnel
`researched[].forecast_id`, and every estimate-bearing funnel entry
carries a forecast_id. On FAIL, write the missing funnel line (or the
missing forecast) in the same commit — committing over a FAIL is a
discipline violation to be named in the next deep retro. The three gaps
were backfilled 2026-08-21 from cycle logs (marked `"backfilled"`; the
18:17Z cycle's third devigged h2h estimate was never recorded anywhere
and is permanently lost — `"acknowledged"` marks that kind of documented
unrepairable gap, and using `acknowledged` on a repairable one is itself
a violation). Pre-weld history (Aug 15–17 box-office and gas-touch
batches) has known gaps; the check's operating window is 24h precisely so
old history doesn't drown current compliance.

**Sixth violation, and the token rule (DEEP-2026-08-22).** On the
mechanical check's first calendar day in force, the 2026-08-21 22:21Z
cycle committed 9 forecasts (7 MLB h2h + 2 TI esports) with no funnel
line — reconcile.py was evidently never run before that commit. The
23:24Z cycle's first reconcile run FAILed, backfilled the line
same-commit, and flagged it: detection worked within one cycle, exactly
as designed; prevention (actually running the check pre-commit) did not.
So the same copy-the-literal-output pattern that ended the cycle-count
fabrications applies here: **the cycle log line of any FULL cycle that
recorded a forecast MUST quote reconcile.py's literal output line
(`OK: funnel<->forecast coverage reconciles over last 24h`); a
forecast-recording log line without that quoted token is a weld
violation on its face**, whether or not the funnel line turns out to
exist. A paraphrase ("reconcile passed") does not count — paraphrases
are how the count fabrications survived; the literal token is proof the
command ran.

**Weld wording closed to triggered ticks (DEEP-2026-09-03).** Every
weld statement above says "FULL cycle", and triggered ticks read that
literally: the 2026-09-02 22:23Z cycle's reconcile run FAILed with 8
gaps, five of them forecasts recorded by the 12:32Z/16:25Z/16:39Z
triggered ticks and the 18:22Z cycle with no funnel line (remediated
same-commit, 36cc4da, per the weld). The duty follows the forecast, not
the tick type: **ANY tick that records a forecast — FULL, LIGHT, or
triggered (`newmarket:`/`pricemove:`) — appends its funnel line in the
same commit, runs reconcile.py, and quotes the literal OK token in its
cycle log line.** A triggered tick that researches one market writes a
one-entry funnel line; "triggered ticks are not FULL cycles" is not a
reading of this rule, it is the seventh instance of the same defect
class (see the six above).

**Skip calls get graded against outcomes by the deep retro** once the
skipped market resolves — the funnel line is the durable record and the
deep retro is the carrier. (First pass DEEP-2026-08-06: CRCL/OXY
market-agrees skips both resolved as priced — correct calls. The
DEEP-2026-08-05 watch item asking hourly cycles to grade them on
resolution day was never executed; watch items alone are not a carrier
for deferred obligations, the same lesson as the b21 settlement-retro
drop.)

**Operational trap (2026-08-15 17:1xZ): `forecast.py record --outcome` takes
the outcome you name, not "the side I have an opinion about" — a mismatch
silently records the complement of the intended belief.** Recorded a
Canada-GDP "less than 0.0%" bracket forecast intending est_prob 0.11 for
the market's stated Yes side (matches market's own Yes=0.107), but passed
`--outcome "No"` with that same 0.11 value — the row now reads "I believe
P(No)=0.11" i.e. P(Yes)=0.89, the opposite of the intended belief, and
disagrees with market by ~0.78 instead of ~0. Forecast rows are immutable
(only core writes forecasts.jsonl); this one (fe954ed9f325, market 3388182)
stays on the books as recorded and will score as a large miscalibration
when it settles — flag it in that retro as a labeling bug, not a belief
failure, so it doesn't get read as evidence about econ-bracket calibration.
Rule going forward: state the target outcome string in the note/reasoning
BEFORE the CLI call, and sanity-check the returned `mid`/`delta_vs_mid`
against the intended direction immediately after recording, since the tool
prints exactly the number needed to catch this before moving on.

**Guard ACTIONED (2026-08-24, DEEP-2026-08-16 proposal):** `forecast.py
record` now refuses any row where `|est_prob - mid| > 0.40` unless
`--confirm-extreme` is passed. This catches the fe954ed9f325 failure
shape (an outcome-label typo silently recording the complement) at the
only moment it's fixable. It also means genuine outside-view-veto-class
disagreements (>0.10 claimed edge can still be well under 0.40 mid-gap,
but a wide one now needs the flag) require `--confirm-extreme` to record
— expect the first prompt rejection on a real extreme read, don't treat
it as a bug, just confirm after re-checking the outcome string matches
intent. fe954ed9f325 itself stays on the books as recorded (forecast
rows are immutable) — the watch item's manual exclusion at ~Aug28
settlement is still required, this guard only prevents the next instance.

**Operational trap (2026-08-20 20:1xZ): at step 0, compare `refs/heads/main`
to `origin/main` — NOT `HEAD`. The container image recurrently starts with a
detached HEAD and a stale local `main` branch ref.** This cycle: HEAD sat at
4c2355c (== origin/main, so my equality check passed and I declared the sync
clean), while `refs/heads/main` was still at ec3eebc, **136 commits behind**.
Every commit then landed on detached HEAD, and `git push origin main` pushed
the *branch* — the stale one — and was rejected with "a pushed branch tip is
behind its remote counterpart". That message names a *behind* condition on a
repo whose work is strictly *ahead*, so it reads as spurious divergence and
invites exactly the wrong reflex (pull --rebase, or worse, a reset). CYCLE.md
step 0 already says to fast-forward when local `main` is strictly behind; the
failure was checking the wrong ref, not a gap in the procedure. Rule going
forward: run `git branch -vv` at step 0 — one line shows both the detachment
and the branch's ahead/behind, which `git log HEAD` cannot. If HEAD is
detached, reattach BEFORE doing any work (`git checkout -B main origin/main`
when the stale ref is an ancestor of `origin/main` — verify with
`git merge-base --is-ancestor`, which is what makes the overwrite provably
lossless; if it is NOT an ancestor the ref holds unpushed local commits, so
stop and log for the operator, never `-B` over it). Recovering after the fact
works the same way (`git checkout -B main <detached-sha>`), but costs a failed
push and tempts a destructive fix under time pressure.

## Exploration budget (DEEP-2026-08-05, operator mandate)

Selection rules learned only from wins overfit to the categories already
tried (currently: soccer/MLB book-devig, econ/cross-market). Each FULL cycle,
spend a bounded slice of research budget — target ~1 candidate, more if the
pool is rich — on something OUTSIDE the current fit profile (fit score ≤2,
or a category with n<5 settled), chosen to test a NAMED hypothesis about one
rubric property (e.g. "weather resolves mechanically; is the benchmark
actually reachable?"). Record the result in the funnel JSONL and cycle log
even when the result is "category not viable" or "benchmark unreachable" —
a ruled-out category with evidence is a selection asset, ruling nothing out
is a blind spot. This is a research-time budget only: exploration candidates
still need edge >= min_edge to get an actual bet; the exploration budget
funds looking, not lowering the bar to place.

**Anti-loophole (DEEP-2026-08-10):** an exploration candidate must test a
rubric PROPERTY not yet characterized, not a new instance of a
characterized one. A new league/competition fed through already-measured
edge machinery does not qualify: the 2026-08-09 21:15Z cycle spent its
exploration slot on Leagues Cup/Brasileirão 3-way devig via odds.py —
the same book-devig pipe whose clean-feed profile (~0.00-0.02 edges vs
tight PM books) was already confirmed across ~40 devigged markets over
the prior 3 days — and predictably re-found the known result. Contrast
the 08-09 05:15Z weather probe (new property: "official forecast JSON as
benchmark — reachable? resolvable?"), which is the intended shape. Before
charging a candidate to the exploration budget, name the property being
tested and why existing evidence doesn't already answer it.

## Market selection

**Scan horizon (OPERATOR EDIT 2026-08-03, see journal/operator-notes.md):**
default to
`python3 core/scan.py --hours 168 --min-volume-24h 0 --min-total-volume 50000`.
The `--min-total-volume` flag is new (operator patch to core/scan.py, same
date) and is REQUIRED to see past today: results page in endDate order and the
near-term universe is thousands of sub-daily markets deep, so `--hours` alone
never escapes the current day — verified, 1004/1004 candidates were day-0.
With the flag, the same scan surfaces ATP/WTA main-draw tennis 5–7 days out
(liquidity $200k–460k), central-bank decisions, and countable-metric markets.
Do NOT also apply a 24h-volume floor on a weekly window: an event five days
out legitimately has little volume today, so that filter re-creates the bug.
Evidence for all of this: 19 straight no-bet cycles on 2026-08-02/03. The 48h
window structurally selects for
whatever clears the volume filter *soon* — Icelandic, Argentine second-tier
and lower-league fixtures — which are exactly the events with no searchable
sharp benchmark, so research fails and no bet is possible. Well-covered
events (major European leagues, MLB/NBA/NFL/WNBA, big esports finals,
scheduled earnings and macro releases) mostly sit 2–7 days out. Longer
horizon also means slower feedback; that is an accepted cost, since feedback
is already gated by resolution lag, not by bet frequency. Revisit if the
weekly window produces placements without improving hit quality.

**Coverage precondition (OPERATOR EDIT 2026-08-03):** before spending research
effort on a candidate, spend ONE search establishing whether a sharp benchmark
is retrievable at all (a real bookmaker line for this exact market, an analyst
consensus, an official schedule/print). If nothing sharp is retrievable, drop
the candidate immediately and move on — do not build an estimate on aggregator
"prediction model" numbers. Scraping consumer odds portals directly does not
work from the cloud runner: forebet/oddsportal/oddspedia 403 datacenter IPs
(this is site-level bot blocking, NOT the sandbox egress policy — the earlier
"recurring egress block" diagnosis in cycle logs was wrong). WebSearch results
do work; use them. Kalshi and Manifold are different: after the operator's
10:53Z egress allowlist update, direct API fetch to
`api.elections.kalshi.com` and `api.manifold.markets` now returns 200 from
this runner (re-verified 2026-08-05 ~13:30Z, see `strategy/tools/kalshi.py`)
— use the direct fetch, it's cheaper and more precise than WebSearch.
Metaculus (`www.metaculus.com/api2`) is still 403 even with the allowlist
(site-side bot block, confirmed from a residential IP too) — WebSearch-by-name
remains the only channel there.

**Odds-API integration (2026-08-08, operator-notes re-open):** `core/odds.py`
(keyed the-odds-api client) is now the benchmark of record for book-devig
arbitration on any sport it covers — prefer it over WebSearch multi-book
consensus there, since it returns decimal lines straight into `devig.py`
without the recurring "stale/wrong-day/reverse-line/contradicting-sources"
search traps documented below (§Search-result traps). Rules for spending it:
1. **Discovery order, not discovery source.** Run `sports` (free) once per
   cycle to see what's in season, but spend `odds`/`scores` calls only on
   candidates that already passed the funnel filters (coverage precondition,
   favorite-framing pre-filter, date/starter pinning) — the ~10-12
   credits/day budget (450/month local cap, `journal/odds-quota.json`,
   `quota` subcommand shows state) is for confirming a benchmark on a
   pre-qualified candidate, not for browsing. The 10-minute cache makes
   within-cycle re-checks free.
2. **`min_edge_book_devig` (0.07) now gets real tests against a clean feed**
   instead of only WebSearch-derived lines — grade the floor with this
   evidence specifically, separate from the WebSearch-sourced book-devig
   record above, once enough settlements accumulate.
3. **WebSearch multi-book consensus stays valid** for sports/markets the API
   doesn't cover — cite which channel (`core/odds.py <sport_key>` vs.
   WebSearch) the rationale used, so retros can tell them apart.
4. **Tennis status is back in scope** via `scores` where the API lists the
   tour — the 2026-08-04 "visible but untradeable" gate no longer applies
   there; still gate on `sports` actually listing the relevant tennis key
   before spending research on a tennis candidate.
If the key is missing or the budget is exhausted, `core/odds.py` exits with
a clear message — log it and fall back to WebSearch, never work around the
guard.
5. **Confirmation-sweep cap (DEEP-2026-08-10).** The clean-feed finding is
   now CONFIRMED, not provisional: across 3 days and ~40 devigged markets
   (MLB -1.5 slates 08-09 08:15Z/11:15Z/14:19Z/04:16Z, WNBA h2h+spreads,
   Leagues Cup/Brasileirão 3-way), every power-devig edge vs a tight PM
   book landed in 0.000-0.020 — under even min_edge, nowhere near
   min_edge_book_devig. Re-demonstrating this daily is cheap in credits
   (cache) but not in research minutes: the 14:19Z cycle re-ran the same
   slate researched 3h earlier to "confirm unchanged". Cap: at most ONE
   sports devig confirmation sweep per day, and only when the slate's
   composition actually changed (new games, not the same games re-checked);
   log it as `cheap-confirmation`, not research. The marginal research
   minutes go to independent-benchmark candidates (econ prints, polls,
   countable metrics) — the only stream that generates scoreable
   disagreements (see Forecast ledger, below).
   2026-10-03 20:1xZ (RETRO-20261003-2015): three more clean-feed rows
   settled (ND-UNC ncaaf 7-book devig, UNL Croatia-England BTTS Poisson,
   UNL Belarus 3-book devig) netting dBrier -0.0181 vs mid, all within
   0.02 of the book; the null holds, no edge-floor change.
   2026-10-04 04:1xZ (RETRO-20261004-0415): Miami-Clemson ncaaf 9-book
   devig settled dBrier -0.0044 vs mid; null holds again. Book-less BTTS
   Poisson self-model is 1-1 vs mid (Den Bosch lost, Argentina-BFA won);
   on Argentina-BFA the haiku 0.18 divergence I dismissed scored better
   than both - track whether screener divergences on strong-favourite
   BTTS rows keep beating the self-model before trusting either (n=1).
   **Cap tightened DEEP-2026-08-13: at most ONE sports devig confirmation
   sweep per WEEK per feed, as a drift spot-check.** The daily cap's own
   evidence condition is met and exhausted: mlb-spreads settled forecast
   n=21 at brier_delta -0.0003, stable across three consecutive slates
   (n=12 → 18 → 21, delta -0.0003/-0.0004/-0.0003; RETRO-20260813-0211
   and -0311 are the second and third confirmations). Every additional
   at-market row adds ~zero information about the only open question
   (disagreement calibration) while spending odds credits and research
   minutes. A weekly one-slate spot-check is enough to detect feed drift;
   anything more is re-demonstrating a solid null. If a spot-check ever
   shows a clean-feed edge ≥ min_edge on a tight book, that is NEW
   information — revert to daily sweeps and say why.
   **Granularity loophole closed (DEEP-2026-08-21): the weekly cap is per
   CHANNEL (the odds-api/multi-book power-devig-vs-tight-PM-book method),
   not per league or market subtype.** The 2026-08-20 window ran the
   compliant weekly MLB sweep (02:17Z) and then four more clean-feed devig
   confirmations in one day by treating each new fixture or sub-market as
   fresh research: La Liga 3-leg (10:34Z), Ligue1 2-leg (14:27Z), MLB h2h
   3-leg (18:17Z), MLB/WNBA h2h (22:18Z). Every one confirmed the same
   null the channel has confirmed at n=132 settled no-edge forecasts,
   brier_delta −0.0004 — dead flat by construction. Sub-slicing (soccer →
   La Liga → Ligue1; mlb-spreads → mlb-moneyline) lets every day be a
   "first instance" of something; that is the pre-2026-08-13 daily-sweep
   behavior wearing a new label. Rule: a new league/market-subtype on this
   channel counts as EXPLORATION for its first ~2 instances only when the
   funnel entry names the hypothesis being tested (e.g. "is NFL preseason
   pricing looser than regular season?" — a real question; "does the
   clean-feed null also hold for Ligue1?" — not one, the null is the
   channel's property, not the league's). After that it folds into the
   ONE weekly confirmation sweep, which may mix leagues. The freed FULL-
   cycle research minutes go where the open questions actually are:
   mechanical-econ (PCE/BoK/GDP cluster), countable metrics, cross-market
   arithmetic, and the tags.py exploration pass.
   **Gate before spend (DEEP-2026-08-22): the weekly-cap gate is checked
   BEFORE any odds.py call, not after.** The 2026-08-21 22:21Z cycle
   devigged a 7-game MLB h2h slate and only then noticed the week's sweep
   was already spent (2026-08-20 02:17Z) — 4 credits and a research slot
   on a null settled at n>21 for this channel; the resulting rows settled
   flat overnight exactly as the channel stats predicted (mlb-moneyline
   n=10, delta −0.0011). The log named the slip unprompted, which is the
   right failure mode — but the gate is one grep against the cycle log
   and costs nothing; run it first. If devig output already exists when a
   violation is noticed, still record the forecasts (honesty rule: an
   estimate formed must be scored), and the cycle log must name the slip,
   as 22:21Z did.

**Home-anchored spread mismatch (TRIGGERED 2026-09-02 09:56Z, `newmarket:4117420`):**
PM always creates its primary MLB spread market keyed to the HOME team at
-1.5 (`mlb-<away>-<home>-...-spread-home-1pt5`), regardless of which side
sportsbooks actually favor. `core/odds.py odds <sport> --markets spreads`
only returns the near-pick'em line — whichever side the market treats as
favorite — not both directions; `alternate_spreads` 422s (not on this
plan's tier). When the home team is NOT the moneyline favorite (this
game: PHI@ARI, devigged moneyline had Phillies 0.508/ARI 0.492, so
sportsbooks quoted Phillies -1.5 / ARI +1.5, never ARI -1.5), the clean
feed cannot benchmark PM's home-anchored market at all — splitting a
team's total win probability into "wins by 1" vs "wins by ≥2" needs a
run-differential model this playbook already vetoes as a self-built
Gaussian (see outside-view veto). The direct, benchmarkable match is
always the SIBLING "Spread: `<favorite>` (-1.5)" market
(`strategy/tools/siblings.py <id>` finds it in one call) — that sibling
re-confirmed clean-feed-null as usual here (4112867 priced 0.395 vs
devigged sportsbook 0.402). Rule: on a newmarket trigger for a PM
home-anchored MLB/WNBA spread, check the moneyline devig first; if home
isn't the favorite, log `benchmark-unreachable` immediately rather than
spending a devig call on the wrong-side market — the favorite-side
sibling is where the real (usually null) signal lives.

**Generalization: the invariant is favorite/underdog, not home/away
(TRIGGERED 2026-09-30 03:38Z, `newmarket:5146462`).** BOS@NYY produced a
`mlb-...-spread-away-1pt5` market, `Spread: Boston Red Sox (-1.5)` (away
team as -1.5 favorite side) — a variant this playbook hadn't named
before (prior instances were always the home-anchored slug). Moneyline
devig (median 8 books, power) had NYY (home) favored 0.558 vs PM 0.555;
the away-anchored candidate (BOS -1.5, i.e. BOS winning by 2+) has no
book equivalent for the same reason a not-favored home spread doesn't —
sportsbooks quote only the favorite's -1.5 / underdog's +1.5, never the
reverse, regardless of which side is home. Logged `benchmark-unreachable`
on 5146462 without spending a devig call on it. The correctly-favorite-
side sibling this game, `Spread: New York Yankees (-1.5)` (5146421, home
AND favorite here), devigged clean: PM 0.35 vs sportsbook power-devig
0.353 — another clean-feed-null. Rule restated to cover both slugs: for
ANY PM `-1.5` spread market (home- or away-anchored slug alike), check
the moneyline devig first; if the team named in that specific market is
NOT the moneyline favorite, log `benchmark-unreachable` immediately —
only the favorite-side sibling (whichever team, whichever slug) is ever
directly benchmarkable from `core/odds.py`'s single reported spread line.

**First clean-feed sweep result (2026-08-09 02:12Z, DEEP-2026-08-09):** the
feed's first working cycle devigged 7 favorite-framed MLB -1.5 spreads and 2
WNBA markets (2+2 credits, 9 books deep): max nominal edge **0.018** at the
mid (MLB, Pirates), 0.025-0.035 (WNBA) — all under base min_edge 0.04, let
alone min_edge_book_devig 0.07. Every prior "big" sports-devig edge in the
settled record came from scraped/stale/wrong-day lines (the 0/7 graveyard);
with a clean, current line the measured gap to tight PM books is ~0.02.
Allocation consequence (one slate, small-n, but it agrees with the whole
settled record): sports devig is now a CHEAP CONFIRMATION step (a couple of
credits, minutes), not a place to spend the research hour. The marginal
research hour goes to mechanical-resolution non-sports — the CPI cluster
(Aug 10-12, FRED/BLS direct), econ-tag markets, post-count brackets near
period end — where the settled evidence (mechanical facts 2W-0L) and the
architecture argument (operator-notes 2026-08-05) already pointed. Run the
sweep, log it, move on; a sports bet now needs the feed to hand you ≥0.07
on a current line, which day 1 suggests is rare.

**Cloud-runner caveat (found first cloud use, 2026-08-08 ~22:1xZ):**
`api.the-odds-api.com` is EGRESS_BLOCKED from the cloud runner specifically
— both urllib and the curl fallback get `CONNECT tunnel failed, response
403` from the sandbox proxy, distinct from a "key not provisioned" exit or
an API-side 401/422. Check which failure you got before logging: a clean
`sys.exit` naming the key/budget is the guard working as designed; a
`Tunnel connection failed`/`curl: (56)` traceback is the egress block —
log "odds EGRESS_BLOCKED (cloud runner)" and fall back to WebSearch, same
as the clevelandfed.org/macromicro.me pattern above. Filed as a proposal
(journal/proposals.md 2026-08-08) — re-check `sports` each cycle in case
the allowlist changes.

**Sensing addition (DEEP-2026-08-05):** `strategy/discovery.py` query 4
("econ-tag", gamma `tag_id=100328`) targets Polymarket's Economy tag with no
volume floor — Fed-rate-decision and GDP-bracket markets that resolve off an
official print/vote, the fact-finality profile the settled evidence favors,
but that queries 1-3's volume/liquidity ordering buries under sports. Check
its yield in scan's stderr each cycle; if it stays empty for several cycles
running, that is itself worth a cycle-log note (query 1 already put these
markets in front of everyone, in which case query 4 is redundant, not
broken).

**Two more search-result traps found this cycle (2026-08-05 04:16Z, zero bets
placed, all candidates failed coverage or showed no edge):**
- **Esports "odds" from WebSearch are frequently Polymarket's own price
  echoed back, not an independent benchmark.** Searches for LCK/LPL/Dota
  matchup odds returned pages titled "... Odds & Predictions | Polymarket"
  and numbers in ¢/×-multiplier format matching PM's own pricing exactly
  (e.g. "JD Gaming favored at 1.35x (74¢)" — 74¢ is a PM price, not a
  sportsbook line). Devigging these against the PM book is circular, not
  book-devig arbitrage. Treat any esports "odds" result as unusable unless
  it names an actual sportsbook (bet365, Pinnacle, GG.bet) with a price —
  and even then, WebFetch on those sites 403s, so only a search-snippet
  number naming the book counts.
- **Tip/prediction-site odds for the same soccer match can openly
  contradict each other across sources, not just diverge from PM.** SK
  Brann vs Apollon Limassol: one snippet gave Brann-win implied ~54%, a
  second gave ~65%, with PM sitting between the two (58.5%) — treat
  cross-source disagreement itself as the "mixed line" signal (existing
  rule below), not just disagreement with PM. Aarhus vs Sabah similarly
  produced an internally inconsistent snippet (a "42.6%" figure paired
  with odds of 1.47, which imply 68%) — a sign the summarizer conflated
  numbers from different parts of the source page. Don't average
  contradictory numbers into an estimate; treat as no-benchmark and skip.
- **WebSearch's summarizer can echo an assumption stated in the query back
  as if it were a found fact (2026-08-05 00:17Z).** Asked a leading
  question about Padres/Diamondbacks total pricing, the search summary
  affirmed "-110 for the 8.5 total... align with standard sportsbook
  pricing" with no actual sportsbook number anywhere in the fetched text.
  An odds claim only counts as a benchmark if it is tied to a quoted
  source figure naming the book; phrase odds queries neutrally (no
  candidate number in the query).

**Three more traps found this cycle (2026-08-05 21:16Z — exploration-budget
weather test + econ re-check + soccer 1X2, zero bets placed):**
- **Weather: mechanical resolution does not imply a reachable point
  benchmark.** Exploration-budget test of the operator's own example
  hypothesis ("weather resolves mechanically; is the coverage there?") on
  Hong Kong Aug-6 highest-temperature brackets (PM implied distribution
  peaking ~33°C across the 32-35°C bracket set). Two forecast sources gave
  materially different numbers for the same nominal date: Hong Kong
  Observatory's own 9-day forecast (the market's stated resolution source)
  said 26-31°C (max 31°C), AccuWeather (Sha Tin station, not confirmed as
  the same station HKO uses for the official reading) said 93°F ≈ 34°C — a
  3°C spread, wider than the 1°C bracket width the market is priced on, with
  station identity unconfirmed on top. Resolves the "mechanical resolution"
  rubric property Yes but "benchmark reachable" No: treat as a
  contradictory-source skip (existing rule), not an edge — the forecast
  disagreement is bigger than the thing being priced. Also corrects
  `discovery.py`'s comment: climate-weather tag 1474 was empty on
  2026-08-05, but general volume/liquidity queries surface ~79 weather
  markets independent of that tag (city-temperature brackets, $2-19k
  liquidity) — tag 1474 being empty does not mean the category is absent
  from the pool.
- **WebSearch can surface a PRIOR year's already-released actuals for a
  still-upcoming release when the query doesn't pin the year tightly and
  the event name recurs annually.** Searching for the July 2026 US jobs
  report (due 2026-08-07, not yet released) returned an fxstreet article
  (URL-dated 2025-08-01) describing that year's July jobs report as already
  landed (unemployment 4.1%→4.2%, payrolls +73k) — i.e. July 2025 actuals,
  not a 2026 forecast, surfaced by a query that said "July 2026" but didn't
  stop the summarizer from matching on "July jobs report" generically.
  Caught here because the numbers read as settled/past-tense for an event
  that hasn't happened; a less careful read could log stale-year actuals as
  current consensus. Cross-check any scheduled-release search result's
  implied publish date against the event's actual date before using it —
  don't trust the query's own year framing to have filtered correctly.
- **Same trap, multi-game-series form: WebSearch for "today's" run line odds
  on a series opener/finale skews toward the PRIOR game in the series, and
  favorites can flip game-to-game (different starting pitchers) — no bet
  placed, caught before placement (2026-08-08 02:13Z).** Scanned 5 same-day
  MLB spread candidates (NYY-1.5, WAS-1.5, ARI-1.5, CLE-1.5, TEX-1.5/-2.5),
  all part of 2-3 game series. Initial searches for "run line odds August 8"
  returned articles explicitly dated/framed for August 7 (one snippet even
  said outright "the game was played on August 7"), not the still-upcoming
  Aug 8 game the PM market resolves on. Devigging that stale line against
  today's PM ask produced an apparently huge edge (~0.10-0.14) on NYY-1.5 and
  WAS-1.5 — but a follow-up search pinned to the correct date and probable
  starters (Braves' Aug 8 starter, Reds' Chase Burns vs Nationals' Alvarez)
  showed the FAVORITE HAD FLIPPED both games: Atlanta (not Yankees) and
  Cincinnati (not Washington) were the correct day's -1.5 favorites. The
  "edge" was an artifact of benchmarking against the wrong game entirely,
  not a real mispricing — and even the corrected line was unusable, since it
  only quotes the actual favorite's -1.5 side (Braves/Reds), leaving PM's
  underdog-framed market (Yankees/Nationals -1.5) with no matching book
  quote (reverse-line-mismatch trap, existing rule). Rule: for any series
  game, confirm the search result's date AND probable starting pitcher names
  match the specific game the PM market resolves on before devigging —
  "today" in a query is not enough to prevent the summarizer surfacing the
  most recent (usually prior) game in the same series. Treat an unconfirmed
  game-date/pitcher match as benchmark-unreachable, not as license to use
  the nearest available number.
- **Odds-comparison sites report "best odds" shopped per side across
  different bookmakers, not one book's coherent line — devigging that
  composite is a version of the cross-book-mixing trap** (first named in
  schedule.json 2026-08-05 17:19Z re: Fenerbahce/Sturm Graz, now formally
  in the playbook). Boca Juniors vs Estudiantes 1X2: "best odds" search
  summary gave Boca 2.15 (one book), draw 3.15, Estudiantes 4.01, but a
  second passage in the same result gave Boca 2.22 at Betsson and draw 3.05
  at Betsson — different books' best-per-side numbers stitched together
  don't represent a single market's true vig or fair prices. Devigging it
  anyway produced a marginal ~0.06 edge on Boca-No, under min_edge_book_devig
  (0.07) regardless, but the number shouldn't be trusted even if it had
  cleared: require a single named book's full multi-way quote (not a
  "best odds across bookmakers" aggregation) before devigging a 3-way line.

**Weather exploration budget, round 2 (2026-08-06 06:25Z) — even the single
official source can disagree with itself.** The 2026-08-05 Hong Kong test
found two different sources 3°C apart. This round tested a well-instrumented
US station (Atlanta/KATL, official NWS gridpoint forecast, `3350823-26`,
4 brackets 84-91°F) on a day with afternoon thunderstorms forecast. NWS's
OWN forecast text gave "high near 90, falling to around 86 in the
afternoon" — a 4°F intraday spread inside ONE official product, before even
counting the ~83-88°F spread across secondary aggregators. On
convective/storm days, "mechanical + official source" is still not
"point-precise enough for 1-2°F brackets" — the uncertainty is physical
(storm timing), not a sourcing problem, so a second corroborating source
won't fix it the way it does for e.g. earnings consensus. Prefer non-
convective, stable-weather days for this category if revisited, or bracket
widths ≥ the NWS's own stated intraday range.

**Exploration budget, UFC main-card moneylines (2026-08-07 16:19Z, first test
of this category).** Hypothesis: "UFC main-card moneylines have dense enough
multi-book sportsbook coverage to devig, and PM either lags or tracks them
loosely enough to leave edge." Gamrot vs Salkilld (UFC Vegas 120, >24h
pre-fight): three independent books (DraftKings, FanDuel, opening line) agree
on favorite and magnitude; power devig (DraftKings) gives Salkilld fair 0.567
vs PM mid 0.575 — within 0.008. Result: **reachable** (multi-book UFC
moneyline coverage is a normal WebSearch hit, unlike the esports-echo trap)
but **no edge** this instance — PM tracks the sportsbook consensus tightly.
Category ruled in, not out; single-book UFC prop markets (KO/TKO, distance)
are a distinct, untested benchmark question — do not assume the same result
transfers to those without checking.
**Second test (2026-08-08 08:15Z), UFC 330 Makhachev vs Machado Garry
(main event, 7 days pre-fight):** multiple books agree closely (FanDuel
-390/+280, DraftKings -325/+240, two other sources -335/+275,+300) —
reachable confirmed a second time. DraftKings power devig: Makhachev fair
0.7426, Garry fair 0.2574; PM live ask Makhachev 0.76, Garry 0.25 (spread
0.01) — edges -0.017 and +0.007, both under min_edge. Same result as the
first test: reachable, tight, no edge. n=2, both no-edge — UFC main-card
moneylines look like an efficiently-tracked market, not a source of edge,
though the sample is still small.

**Exploration budget, Dota 2 esports moneylines (2026-08-20 06:2xZ, first
test since the 2026-08-05 esports-echo trap was named).** Hypothesis
(flagged as an open candidate 2026-08-20 02:17Z, thick TI books $130-390k
liquidity, no benchmark attempted): does odds-api or WebSearch multi-book
coverage exist for The International? odds-api's `sports` list has zero
esports keys (checked live, no `dota`/`csgo`/`lol` entries) — that channel
is closed for this category. WebSearch, however, cleared the esports-echo
check this time: results named actual books (Spinbetter explicitly, plus
an aggregator average) with decimal odds distinct from PM's own price
(e.g. Team Liquid vs Team Yandex: books averaged 1.732/2.014 vs PM ask
implying 1.786 — close but not identical, unlike the 2026-08-05 "74¢ ×
1.35" echo where the odds number literally was the PM price). Two
pre-match TI quarterfinals power-devigged clean: Liquid/Yandex edges
-0.018/+0.008, Nigma/Falcons edges -0.043/+0.033 — both pairs well under
the 0.07 book-devig floor, both PM books 0.01-spread, $150-215k liquidity.
Result: **reachable** (multi-book esports coverage exists via WebSearch
odds-comparison aggregators, same channel as UFC) but **no edge** — PM's
thick TI books track the sportsbook consensus as tightly as MLB/soccer/
WNBA/UFC do. Category ruled in for future book-devig research, not out;
still bound by the existing esports pre-match-only rule (Market selection
§3) — a third TI match in the same event was already in-play at check
time and was correctly declined without forming an estimate. Always
verify any esports odds snippet names a real book with a price
distinguishable from PM's own before devigging — the echo trap is
per-search, not per-category, and does not go away just because one
search cleared it.

**Third moneyline test + first props test (2026-08-16 00:21Z), same
Makhachev/Garry fight, ~3.7h pre-fight via odds.py's clean feed:** h2h
power devig 0.7585/0.2415 vs live ask 0.74/0.27, edges +0.0185/-0.0285 —
n=3, still no-edge, the class stays efficiently-tracked even this close to
first walk. **Exploration budget, single-book method-of-victory props
(first test, named property: does UFC prop coverage have complete
single-book lines the way moneylines do?):** WebSearch surfaced DraftKings
decision/submission odds for both fighters (Makhachev Dec +120/Sub +200,
Garry Dec +450/Sub +3300/KO +1100) but Makhachev's own KO/TKO price was
never quoted by DraftKings in any result — only a FanDuel range (+850/+950)
that the source itself flagged as merely "expected to be similar" on DK,
not an actual DK number. Completing the 6-way distribution would require
substituting a different book for the one missing leg, which is the
cross-book-mixing trap (Boca/Estudiantes precedent) applied to a prop
market instead of a 1X2. Declined rather than mix; **result: UFC props are
only PARTIALLY single-book-coverable from WebSearch (2 of 3 methods per
fighter found on one book, the KO/TKO leg missing) — treat any UFC
method-of-victory candidate as benchmark-unreachable unless a single
source quotes all methods for both fighters from the same book.**

**Exploration budget, ATP/WTA tennis moneylines (2026-08-14 09:1xZ, first
test of this category).** Hypothesis: same shape as UFC-moneyline — dense
multi-book coverage (the-odds-api `tennis_atp_cincinnati_open`/
`tennis_wta_cincinnati_open`, 5-8 books per match) might leave PM lagging or
loose. Three Cincinnati Open matches today, all high-liquidity ($71k-$79k):
Royer/Tsitsipas (8 books, power devig fair 0.231/0.769 vs PM ask 0.24/0.77,
edges -0.009/-0.001), Machac/Carreno Busta (8 books, fair 0.523/0.477 vs PM
ask 0.53/0.48, edges -0.007/-0.003), Zandschulp/Griekspoor (8 books, fair
0.516/0.484 vs PM ask 0.52/0.49, edges -0.004/-0.006). Result: **reachable**
(dense book coverage confirmed, same as UFC) but **no edge** on any of the
6 sides across 3 matches, all |edge| < 0.01 — PM tracks the devigged
consensus about as tightly here as on UFC and MLB. Category ruled in, not
out (n=3 matches, all no-edge, same efficient-market pattern as every other
liquid PM sports book tested so far); revisit only if a lower-liquidity or
in-play match shows a wider gap.

**Politics-primary sensing fix + outside-view veto applied live (2026-08-09
05:xxZ, MN Governor GOP primary, `907983`/`907993`).** The 2026-08-08 18:11Z
cycle logged this candidate benchmark-unreachable ("polls inconsistent across
weeks/sources"). Re-checked with `predictionedge.com/elections/governor/<state>/<race>`
(a poll aggregator that tables each poll by pollster AND date) instead of raw
WebSearch snippets: the apparent inconsistency was a house-effects artifact —
three same-house SurveyUSA waves (Jun 11-16, Jul 15-20, Jul 29-Aug 4) show a
consistent, if narrowing, Lindell lead (27/22, 35/26, 34/28 — gap 5, 9, 6
points), while the "contradicting" numbers came from different, less
frequent houses (Big Data Poll, MN Private Business Council). **Sensing
lesson: when WebSearch snippets on a poll-heavy race look contradictory,
check for a dedicated poll aggregator (predictionedge.com covers US
gov/senate primaries; RealClearPolling for general races) before concluding
benchmark-unreachable — it separates trend-within-house from
house-effect-noise, which raw search summaries conflate.** This is a
methodology fix, not a one-off: add aggregator lookup as a first step for any
multi-poll US primary/general candidate.
Having a clean benchmark, the substantive read: as of Aug 4 polling (7 days
pre-primary, Aug 11), Lindell led the vote-share polling by 6 points with
Qualls drawing ~17% and ~21% undecided; PM prices the WIN probability the
other way (Demuth Yes 0.565 vs Lindell Yes 0.43) — the aggregator's own
"market-implied" panel turned out to just be quoting a prediction market
back, confirming it is not an independent cross-check. **Declined to bet
despite a >0.10 apparent gap**, applying the DEEP-2026-08-07 outside-view
veto: the SurveyUSA trend is public and as available to PM traders as to
this agent, so "my vote-share-to-win-probability read disagrees with the
market's win-probability read" is the same interpretive-forecast shape that
went 0/5 before, not a fact the market structurally couldn't have priced
(unlike an official print or cross-market arithmetic). Logged for the deep
retro to grade once the primary settles Aug 11: if Lindell wins, this is a
foregone-edge data point for loosening the veto on well-evidenced polling
divergences in low-candidate-count primaries; if Demuth wins, it is
confirmation the market/undecided-breakdown knows something a raw
vote-share extrapolation doesn't (matches the Wisconsin Governor primary
precedent, where the market also correctly reflected the polling leader).

**Exploration budget, primary-election win markets (2026-08-07 07:29Z,
distinct from the vote-share brackets below).** Hypothesis: "named-pollster
averages (not just single polls) are a reachable benchmark for primary
win-probability markets close to the vote." Wisconsin Governor Democratic
primary (2026-08-11): two independent named-pollster results (Marquette,
Main Street Action) into early August both show Francesca Hong leading
David Crowley by a wide, stable double-digit margin (38-44% vs 7-15%). PM
prices Hong Yes=0.921, Crowley Yes=0.08 — consistent with a dominant,
stable leader this close to the vote. Result: **reachable** (named-pollster
averages are a normal WebSearch hit for any actively-polled primary) but
**no edge** this instance — market already reflects the polling lead.
Category ruled in (not out): revisit closer-margin primaries, or ones
without recent, WebSearch-findable pollster figures, before generalizing
further.

**Exploration budget, social-media post-count brackets (2026-08-09 02:1xZ,
first test of this category).** Hypothesis: "post-count resolution is
mechanical AND the running count is published live by the resolver itself,
not just estimable" — a stronger reachability claim than any prior category
tested. Confirmed: Polymarket's stated resolution source for "Elon Musk #
tweets <period>?" markets is `https://xtracker.polymarket.com`, and its
public REST API (no auth) exposes the exact running count — `GET
/api/users/elonmusk?platform=x&stats=true` lists every open tracking period
by id, then `GET /api/trackings/<id>?includeStats=true` returns hourly
`daily` counts plus a `cumulative` total for that period. Tested on the
"August 4 - August 11" bracket set (PM brackets: 160-179 Yes=0.135, 180-199
Yes=0.385, 200-219 Yes=0.285, 220-239 Yes=0.095): at query time (4.42 days
of 7 elapsed) cumulative was 126, i.e. ~28.5/day; the API's own `pace` field
(176) is misleading — it divides by `daysElapsed` (5, apparently ceil'd),
not actual elapsed time, understating the run rate. The correct linear
extrapolation (126/4.42*7 ≈ 200) lands almost exactly on PM's 180-199/200-219
boundary, where PM already puts its two largest buckets (67% combined) —
**reachable (exact live source) but no edge**: PM's distribution already
tracks the true pace closely once you extrapolate correctly, and per-day
counts are volatile enough (18-37 across 4 observed full days) that no
single 20-wide bracket clears min_edge against that noise. Category ruled
IN as viable (the API is a stronger benchmark than anything else tested —
exact, live, resolver-authoritative) — worth rechecking near the end of a
period when daysRemaining is small (less extrapolation variance) or on a
bracket set whose current pace sits further from PM's mode than this one
did. **Caveat for reuse:** always compute pace from `cumulative / actual
elapsed days` yourself; do not trust the API's own `pace` field, which
undercounts a still-running partial day as a full one.

**Fat-tail mechanism found on near-end recheck (2026-08-13, RETRO-20260813-1707,
no forecast filed — both prior open forecast rows on this event, `b7a58fd571c8`
et al. from 2026-08-12, blocked a duplicate).** A Gaussian model of the
running count (mean from elapsed-days pace, sd from the daily-count series)
systematically UNDERSTATES the right tail relative to the market: on the
Aug7-14 Musk event at 23h remaining (cumulative 138, model N(159.74, 7.85)),
the model gave the 180-199 + 200-219 brackets combined ~0.6% while the book
(siblings.py, sum_check 0.9875 — a well-calibrated book) priced them at
8.85% combined. This isn't noise-sized: it's an order of magnitude, and it's
directional (Gaussian always under-weights tails vs. any real bursty count
process — a single high-volume posting day, retweet storm, or news-driven
spike). Consequence: the model's claimed edge on the modal brackets
(140-159 here, edge 0.133 vs the veto's 0.10 boundary) is inflated by the
same mechanism that starves the tail — probability mass the Gaussian denies
the tail has to go somewhere, and it lands in the bulk brackets, manufacturing
a fake edge there even when the true mean estimate is fine. This is the
same "large claimed edge in an efficient, information-rich market = modeling
gap, not alpha" pattern as the SPX Brownian-bridge case, now with an
identified mechanism specific to this category: **do not use a plain
Gaussian for these brackets near a boundary; either fatten the tail
(mixture, or empirical bootstrap off the observed daily-count series) or
treat any Gaussian-derived edge here as presumptively overclaimed and route
it through the outside-view veto regardless of nominal size.**

**Graded (DEEP-2026-08-14): the prediction above settled correct within
12 hours.** Both of the model's center-mass brackets resolved No — 120-139
(5ef2f363f039, est 0.165, RETRO-20260813-2130) and 140-159 (b7a58fd571c8,
est 0.64, the model's modal bracket, RETRO-20260814-0045). Together those
two legs carried ~80% of the Gaussian's probability mass; the count landed
above both, i.e. in exactly the right tail the model starved. Two
same-model, same-direction misses on the highest-mass legs is a mechanism
confirmation, not variance. The open 160-179 (market 0.385 vs model 0.189)
and 180-199 (0.095 vs 0.003) rows grade the market's side of the same
comparison at settlement.

**Graded again (2026-08-14 09:05Z, RETRO-20260814-0905): 160-179 also
settled No** (e06e9b2bea70, est 0.189). n=3 now, all same model instance,
all same direction — the count has landed above every bracket checked so
far, tracking the market's fatter-tail pricing rather than the Gaussian's.

**Fully graded (2026-08-14 19:16Z, RETRO-20260814-1916): 180-199 settled
Yes** (eb09f3632c5d, est 0.003) — the true count landed in 180-199 itself,
the exact bracket the Gaussian starved to 0.3%, not the 200+ tail beyond it.
All four same-model siblings on this event are now settled (120-139 No,
140-159 No modal-bracket miss, 160-179 No, 180-199 Yes), same direction
throughout: a plain elapsed-pace Gaussian is confirmed unusable for this
category's tail brackets (est 0.003 vs. an outcome the market's own book
priced around 9.5%) — not a one-off, a repeatable mechanism. The outside-view
veto correctly blocked a bet on this leg pre-settlement; no ledger loss. n=4
is still below the ~15-settlement floor-change threshold, so no numeric
min_edge change yet, but the modeling requirement (fatten the tail — mixture
or empirical bootstrap off the observed daily-count series — before trusting
any Gaussian-derived edge on this category's outer brackets) is now
confirmed rather than provisional. This event's sibling set is closed out;
next test is a fresh event/pace, not a re-check of this one.

**Test in progress (DEEP-2026-08-15, pre-registered reading).** The
2026-08-15 04:18Z cycle ran the required bootstrap (14-day empirical
daily-count resample) on two fresh events: the Aug11-18 weekly set (5
rows, 70331099597c…cf16f6424af7) and the first 2-day window Aug13-15
(10029a75295e, 53c5bf348303 — settles ~Aug 15 16:00Z; weekly settles Aug
18 16:00Z). The bootstrap still disagrees with the market by >0.10 on two
weekly legs (180-199 est 0.494 vs 0.325; 220-239 est 0.024 vs 0.145).
Reading committed BEFORE settlement: if the market again beats the model
on the large-disagreement legs, the verdict escalates from "wrong tail
shape" (fixed by the bootstrap) to "self-model class untrustworthy in
this category at any model sophistication" — i.e. a permanent category
bar like contested primaries, forecast-only. If the bootstrap materially
beats the market on those legs, the Gaussian, not the class, was the
problem, and the category stays estimate-bearing under the veto. Grade
same-tick at each settlement against exactly this fork.

**Fork settled, mixed (2026-08-18 18:16Z, RETRO-20260818-1816).** Both
decisive legs are in. 180-199 LOST (model brier 0.244 vs market 0.106 —
market beat the model by 0.138 on the modal bracket, the model's single
most confident prediction in the set). 220-239 WON (model brier 0.0006 vs
market 0.021 — model beat the market by 0.020). Net over the two legs:
brier delta −0.118, market ahead in aggregate, but driven almost entirely
by the one large miss, not a uniform beating. **Neither pre-registered
branch triggers cleanly** — this is not "market beats on the
large-disagreement legs" (only one of two, decisively; the other went to
the model) and not "bootstrap materially beats" (net is negative).
Following the same conservative default the mechanical-econ fork commits
to for its own mixed case: the veto boundary (0.10) stays untouched, no
carve-out for the bootstrap sub-class, and it is NOT escalated to a
permanent category bar either — the fork stays open, folded back into
ordinary self-model tracking rather than resolved. The 180-199 miss
repeats a pattern now seen three times (this leg, the Aug15-17 set's <40
leg, box-office Spider-Man 66-68m): the model's highest-confidence
bracket is where it has missed worst. 160-179 (c24926a5c9d7) is still
open — not one of the two designated legs, but its eventual settlement
(the true count almost certainly lands there, by elimination against the
other four brackets) is a bonus, non-decisive data point worth logging
when it lands.

**First settlement, off-fork (2026-08-15 18:12Z, RETRO-20260815-1812):** the
Aug13-15 2-day pair's 65-89 leg (`53c5bf348303`) settled No against a
bootstrap est of 0.501 and a market ask of 0.63 — model brier 0.251 vs
market brier 0.384, model beat market by 0.133 on this leg. This pair is
NOT the pre-registered fork (that's the weekly 180-199/220-239 legs,
settling Aug 18) — it's a useful early n=1 data point in the bootstrap's
favor but does not resolve the fork. The sibling 40-64 leg (`10029a75295e`)
is still open. No bet either way (outside-view veto still applied).

**Pair complete, still off-fork (2026-08-15 19:12Z, RETRO-20260815-1912):**
the sibling 40-64 leg (`10029a75295e`) settled Yes against a bootstrap est
of 0.499 and a market ask of 0.40 — model brier 0.251 vs market brier
0.372, model beat market by 0.121. Both legs of the Aug13-15 pair now agree:
bootstrap beat market (n=2). Still off-fork — the fork verdict is decided
only by the weekly 180-199/220-239 legs settling Aug 18. No bet either way.

**Counting caution (DEEP-2026-08-16):** the two legs of this pair are
complementary claims on the SAME realized count — once the count landed in
40-64, both "40-64 Yes" and "65-89 No" were decided by that single fact,
and the bootstrap's edge over the market on both legs is one insight
double-counted, not two replications. Treat the pair as n=1 independent
outcome in any fork or veto-record reasoning (the same convention the veto
ledger already applies to the weekly sibling sets).

**Cloud-runner egress note (2026-08-09 02:1xZ):** `api.the-odds-api.com`,
`gamma-api.polymarket.com`, `clob.polymarket.com`, `clevelandfed.org`, and
`xtracker.polymarket.com` were ALL reachable from the cloud runner this
cycle with no proxy errors — the 2026-08-08 EGRESS_BLOCKED entries
(journal/proposals.md) were evidently transient/flapping, not a standing
gap; re-verify reachability each cycle rather than assuming yesterday's
block still holds, and don't skip a source without trying it first.

**Exploration budget, politics vote-share brackets (2026-08-06 19:13Z, first
test of this category).** Hypothesis: "vote-count resolution is mechanical;
is a constituency poll a granular enough benchmark for a 10-point bracket?"
Tested on the Clacton by-election Count Binface vote-share brackets
(5 mutually-exclusive brackets, siblings-verified `_sum_check` 1.041, normal
vig). A single Survation constituency poll (2026-08-02) put Binface ~20%.
PM's bracket prices (10-20%: 44.5%, 20-30%: 42.5%, <10%: 8%, 30-40%: 6.3%,
≥40%: 2.8%) straddle the poll's 20% point almost exactly evenly — the book is
already well-calibrated to the one available poll. Result: **reachable**
(a single constituency poll is enough to benchmark a bracket set here) but
**no edge** this instance — the market isn't lagging the poll, it's pricing
it correctly. Politics vote-share brackets stay open as a category (ruled
in, not out); revisit when multiple polls disagree or a poll updates after
the book was last priced.

**Durable lessons never live only in `schedule.json` reason fields
(DEEP-2026-08-05).** The reason field is overwritten every full cycle; the
leading-question trap above was originally documented only there and
survived solely in git history. Any instrument finding or method trap
worth keeping goes in this playbook in the same cycle that finds it.

**Forecast-batch carrier checklist (DEEP-2026-08-17, after 4 dated
misses).** Recording a batch of forecasts creates two obligations that
MUST land in the SAME commit as the batch, or they get silently dropped:
(1) a `strategy/funnel.jsonl` line for the cycle (operator mandate
2026-08-05 §2 — the 2026-08-15 box-office cycle and the 2026-08-17 00:31Z
gas-price cycle both recorded estimate-bearing batches with no funnel
line); (2) a `schedule.json` watch_items entry naming the settlement
date, the row ids, and any reading rule (exclusions, one-independent-
outcome counting) — the box-office, Musk 2-day, UMich, and gas-price
batches all shipped without one and each had to be back-filled by a deep
retro. watch_items is the only carrier hourly ticks actually read
(DEEP-2026-08-14); a batch without a carrier is a grading that will not
happen. Empty FULL cycles: write the funnel line anyway (researched: [])
— 2026-08-16 15:19Z did, 19:14Z/23:21Z didn't; pick the convention that
keeps the funnel↔cycle reconciliation mechanical.

**Checklist compliance, graded (DEEP-2026-08-18): 1 of 5 applicable
batches in the first 24h after this rule landed.** The funnel-line half
went 5/5; the watch-item half went 1/5 (missed: EPL Aug 21-24 batch, BoI/
Iran rows, the HD earnings VETO row settling the same day, the market-cap
pair; written: FL primary). The misses were exactly the load-bearing
cases, so the rule's scope is right and compliance is the failure.
Mechanism fix — weld the watch-item decision to the step that IS being
executed reliably: **immediately after writing the funnel line, answer
one question in the same breath: does any forecast in this batch (a)
settle later than ~24h out, (b) feed the veto/counterfactual ledger
(outside-view-veto, wide-spread-veto, category-bar), or (c) carry a
reading rule (exclusions, one-independent-outcome counting)? If yes, the
watch item goes in the SAME commit. If genuinely no (plain no-edge rows
settling within ~24h, covered by the same-tick settlement carrier), a
watch item is optional.** Also mandatory in every funnel line:
`pool_by_query`/`pool_total` (3 of 7 FULL lines omitted them 2026-08-17/18
while the cycle log carried the counts — the funnel line is where
reconciliation happens; duplicating the numbers there is the point).

**Re-research cooldown + pacing (DEEP-2026-08-04).** A candidate researched
to a no-edge / no-benchmark conclusion stays concluded for ~2 hours unless
something new happens (material line move, news, event-status change).
Evidence: the 2026-08-04 01:15Z and 02:15Z cycles re-derived identical
no-edge conclusions on the same UCL qualifiers 55 minutes apart, both
logging "no new information"; 03:20Z partially repeated them again. When
the entire window is in that state — every candidate either concluded
within the cooldown or gated on an unreachable benchmark — set
`strategy/schedule.json` `next_full_cycle_after` to the next event
boundary (kickoff, report time, new candidates entering the scan window)
instead of running another full cycle. Deferral spends no capital; its
only cost is a delayed info-race discovery, so keep deferrals ≤3h and
never past a known event start. Settling and open-position monitoring
happen every tick regardless (schedule.json contract).

**Prefer mechanically-resolving markets.** Consistent with the fact-finality
rule, markets that resolve off an official print, close, or scoreboard
(earnings, macro releases, match results) beat markets needing a judgment call
about a source or a rules reading — the ai-leaderboard and Iran pairs cost $20
between them on resolution-process risk ($15 now settled-lost, $5 still stuck).

**Scheduled-release triage rule (DEEP-2026-08-05).** Every full cycle:
identify the scheduled-release candidates in the pool (earnings-beat,
macro/inflation/central-bank prints, countable-metric deadlines), NAME
them in the cycle log, and disposition each (research now / defer to a
stated cycle nearer the print / skip with reason). Evidence: a July
inflation bracket cluster (annual 3.3%, annual 3.4%, monthly ≥0.1%, all
end 2026-08-12) sat in the 400+-candidate pool while ~37 consecutive
cycles spent their research budget on sports/esports whose benchmarks are
known-blocked; the operator's 2026-08-04 pivot directive names exactly
this category. These markets have reachable, mechanical benchmarks
(official statistical releases, analyst consensus) — read the description
first to pin the exact source and threshold, and check book depth/spread
before treating the mid as real. Current priority: the July inflation
cluster — bracket legs are mutually exclusive siblings, so cross-market
consistency (probabilities summing >1 across brackets) is checkable
arithmetic, our strongest settled edge class (`1e8dec1078ba`).

**Pre-research event-time check (DEEP-2026-08-04, consolidating the two
2026-08-03 findings below).** For any market tied to a scheduled event
(match, series, scheduled report/print): pin down the actual start time —
from the market description or one targeted search — BEFORE deeper
research. `end_date`, `outcome_prices`, and scan mids are all unreliable
about whether the event has started. If the event has started, or its
status cannot be verified, skip. Evidence: the tennis and MLB findings
below, plus 2026-08-04 04:16Z — Draper and Tsitsipas matches showed
plausible paper edges against real bookmaker lines, but every live-score
source (Sofascore, Flashscore, ESPN, TennisExplorer, Olympics.com) 403'd
and match status could not be pinned down; both correctly skipped. An
unverifiable event is not a discount on the edge, it is a veto.

**`end_date` is not the actual match/event time for tennis draws (2026-08-03
finding).** Six National Bank Open / Canadian Open / DC Open candidates in
one scan all carried `end_date` of 2026-08-09 or 2026-08-10 (the tournament's
last day), but WebSearch on the actual matchups showed real scheduled times
of 2026-08-02/08-03 — e.g. Berrettini vs Navone: scan `end_date` 2026-08-10,
actual scheduled time 2026-08-03 16:35 UTC (today); Frech vs Jeanjean and
Boisson vs Ruzic: actual dates 2026-08-02 (yesterday), yet their live books
were still mid-range (0.70-0.88), not resolved-looking. `end_date` for these
markets is evidently a tournament-level fallback/dispute deadline, not the
match's real time — do not assume a scan candidate is safely pre-match
because its `end_date` looks days out. Verify the actual scheduled time (or
live status) per-candidate before researching or betting; if it can't be
pinned down, treat as possible in-play and skip (same reasoning as the
esports in-play rule). This cycle, Fritz vs Jodar showed a similarly
suspicious pattern independent of this issue: pre-match sportsbook odds
implied Fritz ~65%, but the live PM book was 0.92-0.93 bid/ask with >20k
depth — almost certainly in-play with Fritz already dominant, so the
sportsbook "benchmark" was stale, not the PM price. Skipped.

**Scan does not flag in-play status for single-game moneylines (2026-08-03
finding).** WSH/PHI and STL/NYY MLB moneylines both showed large price
divergence from pregame bookmaker consensus on deep, 1-cent-spread books
($170k-295k liquidity) — looked exactly like a book-devig edge. Checking
wall-clock time against the listed first pitch (in the market description,
not `end_date`) showed both games had started 13-38 minutes earlier; the
price move was in-play information, not a mispricing. `outcome_prices` and
`end_date` are both stale/uninformative about in-play status. Before
researching or betting any single-game team-vs-team market (not just
esports), check current time against the actual listed start time in the
description; if the game has started, skip — same rule as esports in-play,
now confirmed to apply to traditional sports moneylines too.

**MLB `Spread: TeamX (-1.5)` markets are per-team, not per-game — verify
which team is the actual moneyline favorite before searching for a
bookmaker run line (2026-08-06 15:41Z finding, 5-game sample).** Polymarket
creates a separate -1.5 spread market for each team, e.g. an event can
carry `Spread: Team A (-1.5)` and/or `Spread: Team B (-1.5)` independently,
and which ones exist varies by game — sometimes only the underdog's (an
alternate line: "underdog wins outright by 2+", a much rarer event than
the standard "favorite lays 1.5"). A single bookmaker "run line" search
(favorite -1.5 / dog +1.5) only prices the FAVORITE's -1.5 side; if PM's
listed market is for the underdog's -1.5 instead, the numbers aren't
comparable at all — buying either side off that mismatch is not a devig,
it's noise. Confirm the PM moneyline favorite (or a moneyline search)
matches the team named in the PM spread market before devigging against a
bookmaker run line. In this cycle's sample: Marlins/Braves and
Diamondbacks/Padres had PM markets on the underdog/coinflip side only
(skipped, mismatched); Twins/Royals had a bookmaker run-line search that
named the wrong favorite entirely (contradicted by both PM's and a second
search's moneyline — discarded as an unreliable source, another instance
of the cross-source-contradiction rule); only Tigers/Mariners had a
verified favorite-side match, and its devig edge (0.014-0.018) came in
under `min_edge_book_devig` (0.07) on both legs — no bet, but the match
methodology held up and is worth reusing.

**Selection pre-filter for this category (DEEP-2026-08-08, from the
funnel record).** The 2026-08-07/08 window spent 15 of 35 research slots
on mlb-spreads and got 9 benchmark-unreachable skips and 0 bets —
`strategy/funnel.jsonl` cycles 04:15Z–02:13Z. The unreachables are
structural, not bad luck: an underdog-framed `Spread: TeamX (-1.5)` (X is
not the book favorite) has NO matching book quote by construction (books
quote favorite -1.5 / dog +1.5; dog -1.5 is a rarer alt line few books
carry), and series games add the wrong-day/starter-flip trap on top. So
run the two cheap checks AT SELECTION TIME, before the candidate gets a
research slot: (1) one moneyline lookup to confirm the PM spread's named
team IS the favorite — if not, log the candidate straight to the funnel
as benchmark-unreachable (fit-score benchmark=N) and spend the slot
elsewhere; (2) for any series game, the date+probable-starter pin
(2026-08-08 02:13Z rule above) before any devig. Full research effort is
reserved for favorite-framed, date-pinned spreads — the only
configuration that has ever produced a usable benchmark match in this
category (Tigers/Mariners 2026-08-06; the 2363018c118b win).

**Timeline-rumor research cap (DEEP-2026-09-02, from the funnel record).**
The 2026-09-02 00:28Z and 04:13Z FULL cycles each spent 3 of 4 research
slots on ai-model-release timeline-rumor questions (Gemini Flash by-Sep2
re-check + its exact-Sep2 sibling + OpenAI Astra), every one of which is
structurally unbettable by construction — the fact-finality gate vetoes
rumor-based release-timing edges regardless of the estimate, and
ai-model-release is also the forecast book's worst category (brier_delta
+0.188 on n=11, albeit rumor-correlated). Calibration practice on these
is worth ONE slot, not most of the cycle's budget. Rule: at most ONE
research slot per FULL cycle goes to fact-finality-gated timeline-rumor
candidates, and sibling markets on the same underlying event (by-date /
exact-date ladders) share that single slot — a coherent family estimate
is one research act. Exception: an official confirmation landing (the
event stops being a rumor) lifts the cap for that event, since the
market may then be bettable as an info-race.

**AI release-date anchoring rule (RETRO-20260928-2015).** When no primary
source (an official post, docs page or named-exec statement) gives a date,
the recorded est_prob for an AI or product release-date rung (by-date or
exact-date) is the ladder mid. A lean built from leaks or aggregators goes
in the note as "shade view: X" and does not go into est_prob. Evidence: 7 of 7
"later than the market" reads have now resolved against me. These are the
four Opus No-reads on 09-22/23 and the three Sonnet 5.5 rows on 09-28
(`298455f0923c`, `b5144f22aaaa`, `e4910305e1c3`: own 0.38/0.55/0.65 vs mid
0.475/0.68/0.875, each dBrier about +0.10). ai-model-release forecasts sit at
brier_delta +0.0838 on n=35. A primary-source check (news page, models page)
still runs, but only a POSITIVE finding (the launch is live, or an official
date) moves est_prob off the mid. "Not out yet" earlier on the day moves
nothing. Re-grade the shade views at n=8.

**Treasury touch drift rule (RETRO-20260928-2215).** For a Treasury
par-yield touch rung ("hit X% in <month>") with 5 or fewer prints left,
the recorded est_prob is the RAW bootstrap (drift kept), updated for the
overnight futures move. Driftless and demeaned reads go in the note as
"shade view: X" and never into est_prob. Evidence: every near-rung row
that dropped drift lost to the mid, 5 of 5 (`03f07792d701`, `fdedb184ad3e`,
`8b9d86b667bb`, `3ed526b57eca`, `84012264b65d`); the one raw-bootstrap
row `99df204b7f85` (0.67 vs mid 0.54) beat the mid. Far-rung sd (model
wider than PM's compressed ladder, RETRO-20260924-2213) is untouched.
Touch rows stay forecast-only. Re-grade at the next monthly ladder.

Work from `core/scan.py` output (protected filters already applied).
Prefer, in order:
1. **Earnings-beat markets** (`Will X beat quarterly earnings?`) — resolve
   same evening. Research: consensus EPS estimate, whisper numbers, the
   company's historical beat rate (most large caps beat 75–85% of quarters),
   recent guidance, peer results this season. Suspect mispricing when the
   price is far from the historical beat base rate without news to justify it.
   Sharpened from the 2026-08-04/05 CRCL and OXY passes (3 cycles, no bets):
   - **GAAP vs non-GAAP is a mandatory first check.** The market's fixed
     threshold names a basis; consensus numbers usually don't. CRCL's
     threshold was GAAP $0.16 while every findable consensus ($0.165-$0.19)
     was non-GAAP — applying one to the other is a methodology error, not
     an edge (04:16Z catch, correct skip).
     **Extension (2026-08-06 03:13Z, ABNB `3074288`):** GAAP-specific
     consensus is frequently just unfindable via WebSearch, not merely a
     basis-mismatch risk — every source for Airbnb's Q2 2026 report
     (Yahoo, TipRanks, StockStory, MarketBeat) reported non-GAAP/adjusted
     EPS ($1.19-$1.26) while the market's threshold was GAAP $1.25; no
     source gave a standalone GAAP figure. Treat "no GAAP-basis number
     found" as benchmark-unreachable by default for GAAP-threshold beat
     markets, the same as a basis mismatch — don't fall back to the
     non-GAAP consensus as a stand-in.
   - **"Consensus clears the threshold" is not an edge when PM already
     prices it ≥~0.80** (CRCL 0.845, OXY 0.91): the market has the same
     consensus. The tradeable shapes are (i) PM price *contradicting* the
     consensus direction, or (ii) a threshold sitting far outside the
     analyst range while PM lags near base rates. Absent those, log
     "market confirms, no edge" once and let the cooldown hold it.
     **Recheck stop rule (DEEP-2026-08-13):** after a market-confirms /
     no-edge log, a recheck is warranted only by NEW information (fresh
     guidance, a filing, a named headline) — never by elapsed time alone.
     Two consecutive rechecks concluding "no new information, book moved
     further toward consensus" close the candidate until resolution; log
     the closure once in funnel notes and stop touching it. Evidence:
     AMAT (`3347174`) was re-researched 4 times in 11h (17:20Z, 21:19Z,
     01:15Z, 04:14Z on 2026-08-12/13) with an unchanged est 0.90 and the
     identical conclusion each time — three of those touches bought no
     information and cost attention the disagreement-generating
     categories should have had.
   - **Graded (DEEP-2026-08-06):** CRCL (`3074337`) and OXY (`3074403`)
     both resolved YES — the market-confirms skips at 0.845/0.91 held up;
     no edge was foregone by declining to buy an unmodeled favorite.
     First outcome evidence for this rule (n=2, keep grading).
   - **Graded (DEEP-2026-08-07, the full 2026-08-06 reporting slate):**
     all six Aug-6 reporters resolved YES (beat). Per disposition:
     ED (`3074274`, skipped no-edge) — the tentative ~0.045 edge was on
     **No**, built on self-inconsistent WebSearch beat-rate data; ED beat,
     so the data-quality veto avoided a -$5 loss. AKAM/Yelp/DBX/NET
     market-agrees skips all resolved as priced — market-confirms rule now
     outcome-graded at n≈6 with zero foregone edge. MNST (`3074320`,
     benchmark-unreachable: GAAP trap + 0.10 spread) beat — the bullish
     4/4-beat signal would have won, so fails-closed rules have a
     measured cost column now (1 foregone win) as well as a savings
     column (ED, CRCL-basis catches); at n=1 each way, keep the rules,
     keep counting both columns. ABNB (`3074288`, fails-closed on
     unfindable GAAP consensus) beat — outcome consistent with its high
     price, skip graded neutral/cheap insurance.
   - **Graded (DEEP-2026-08-08):** UAA (`3089555`) resolved YES. The
     no-signal skips (threshold $0.02 = consensus exactly, $187 book,
     last priced ~0.52-0.62) grade as process-correct /
     outcome-uninformative — with no directional signal there is no
     foregone-edge claim either way on a coin-flip-priced market.
     Market-confirms tally unchanged at n≈6, zero foregone edge.
2. **Soccer daily match markets** — resolve at final whistle. Research: recent
   form, injuries/rotation news, home/away splits, league table stakes,
   odds at conventional bookmakers (the sharpest available benchmark — if
   Polymarket materially diverges from bookmaker-implied probability, that is
   the signal).
3. **Esports pre-match only** (never in-play — the book moves faster than I
   can research). Research: team ratings (HLTV for CS, etc.), map pools,
   recent roster changes. Thin books here: check the spread before trusting
   the price.
4. **Short-horizon news/politics** — only when a resolution-relevant fact is
   already public but not yet priced. Caveat (2026-07-30): "not yet priced"
   must mean the BOOK, not the scan mid. Near-resolution markets (commodity
   daily closes, IPO-day closes) show stale mids while makers have already
   moved asks to 0.98+. The window between fact-public and book-repriced is
   usually gone by the time scan surfaces it — verify with the live book
   before spending research time.

Avoid: anything the protected config bans (sub-daily crypto), in-play markets,
markets whose resolution criteria I don't fully understand after reading the
description, books with spread > risk.json `max_spread` (scope below).

### Spread-rule scope (DEEP-2026-08-01)

`max_spread` is a HARD veto for book-devig / benchmark-derived bets and for
any market where my own estimate is uncertain: a wide book there means the
benchmark comparison is unreliable and the market is telling me something I
don't know (correctly applied to ENA/XRP retrospective-fact markets,
2026-08-01 03:11Z).

Narrow exception — **structural info-race only**: positions are held to
resolution (never exited) and fill at the ask, so exit liquidity is
irrelevant; a wide bid/ask on a market whose resolving fact is verified by
multiple independent sources is the signature of the inattentive book this
class targets (both structural wins came from 0.01–0.06-spread books; all
seven book-devig losses from 1-cent books). A bet may exceed `max_spread`
only if ALL hold: (1) info-race class, fact multi-source verified;
(2) edge at the ASK ≥ `risk.json min_edge_wide_book` (0.30); (3) the cycle
log explicitly states the bid/ask/spread and invokes this exception.

**Tightened (DEEP-2026-08-05, enacting the b21-loss pre-registration from
DEEP-2026-08-02):** condition (1) now additionally requires the resolving
fact to be FINAL/MECHANICAL (per the fact-finality requirement) and
confirmed by at least one non-party primary source. Evidence:
`b21e42c123a1` — the bet whose profile partly calibrated this exception —
settled lost; its "multi-source verified" fact was state-media consensus
on a contested claim, and the resolver read it the other way. A wide book
plus a contested fact is the market pricing resolution risk, not
inattention.

Violation on record: `b21e42c123a1` (2026-07-31 23:15Z) was placed at
spread 0.13 with no mention of the spread in the cycle log — a silent skip
of a written check. Whatever a bet's merits, a rule that seems wrong gets
flagged in a retro and proposed for change; it does not get silently
ignored. Every placement's cycle-log entry must state the spread check
from now on.

**Exploration budget, AI model release-date markets (2026-08-11 02:xxZ, first
test of this category).** Hypothesis: "product release-date markets have a
reachable benchmark (official roadmap, credible leak) the way earnings/econ
releases do." Tested on `3206142` (Gemini Pro release by Aug 14, PM Yes
0.065). WebSearch surfaced only rumor-aggregator blogs (coursiv.io,
codersera.com, cometapi.com, felloai.com, androidinfotech.com) with mutually
conflicting rumored dates — none citing a primary Google statement with a
specific date. One credible secondary mention: Bloomberg reported the model
"months behind schedule", and Google itself said 2026-07-21 it is "currently
testing with partners" (still no ship date). Result: **not reachable for
date precision** — same shape as the esports-echo and tip-site traps, an
aggregator swarm around a real but vague signal — though the vague signal
(delayed) is directionally corroborated by Bloomberg and agrees with PM's
own low pricing. Recorded market-agrees, not benchmark-unreachable, since
the direction (not the date) was confirmable. Category ruled OUT for
date-precision bets absent a primary-source (official blog post, SEC
filing, named-exec statement) announcement with an actual date; revisit
only if one surfaces for a specific candidate.

**Exploration budget, NFL player-trade-destination markets (2026-08-18
21:xxZ, first test of this category).** Hypothesis: "sports-media trade
speculation has a reachable benchmark (a beat-writer/insider report with a
specific team and probability-bearing signal) the way roster/injury news
does." Tested on `1387121` (Tyreek Hill -> Vikings by Aug 31, PM Yes 0.452,
liquidity $69) and `1361018` (Maxx Crosby -> Cowboys by Sep 1, PM Yes
0.0645, liquidity $1080). WebSearch on both surfaced only the same
rumor-aggregator-blog swarm as the AI-model-release category above —
"chatter," "cryptic social media comment," "hears trade chatter," dueling
takes from SI/Yardbarker/Heavy/fansided — with no team, executive, or
league source confirming a specific pending trade on either leg; the one
concrete fact found (a Cowboys-Crosby trade *fell through* at the
2026-02/03 deadline over a failed physical) is old and already priced in.
Result: **not reachable for a specific-destination call** — same shape as
the AI-release trap, an aggregator swarm around real-but-vague interest
signals, no primary source to independently price against the market's own
rumor-sentiment read. Recorded `benchmark-unreachable`, no forecast (no
credible independent estimate formed, per the no-invented-estimate rule).
Category ruled OUT for "will player X land on team Y" markets absent a
primary-source (team/league official, or a specific insider report naming
terms) announcement; revisit only if one surfaces for a specific
candidate. Distinct from settled roster-status facts (played/inactive/
released), which are mechanical and would score differently on property 1.

**Exploration budget, foreign general-election seat-place brackets
(2026-08-19 00:xxZ, first test of this category, market `2915350` "Will
Auyl win the second most seats in the 2026 Kazakh Kurultai elections?",
PM Yes ask 0.80 spread 0.02 liq $24.9k, election Aug 23).** Hypothesis
under test: does this clear the general-election-extension's carve-out
(playbook §Durable rule (contested primaries) > Extension to general
elections — "elections WITH credible numeric polling... go through the
normal estimation path")? WebSearch's own summary claimed three national
surveys placing Auyl clearly 2nd; a direct WebFetch on a second source
(timesca.com) found only ONE named poll (Kaliyev, published May 27 — 3
months stale relative to the Aug 23 vote), naming a DIFFERENT party as
frontrunner (Amanat, not Adilet — likely rebrand/naming confusion the
summarizer didn't catch), and explicitly describing the 2nd/3rd-place seat
as contested: "Auyl was not widely viewed as the leading contender for
third place... most observers expected that role to belong to Ak Zhol,"
with only a late, non-numeric perception shift cited for Auyl. Same
WebSearch-summary-vs-source-conflation shape as the HK-weather and
stale-year-actuals traps above, this time on poll *count* and *frontrunner
identity* rather than a number. Result: fails the extension's "credible
numeric polling" gate — the one real poll is stale and contradicted, not a
tracker. Recorded `benchmark-unreachable`, no forecast. Category ruled OUT
for foreign election seat-place brackets absent either (a) a numeric poll
corroborated by a second independent source that agrees on both the
frontrunner and the poll's existence, or (b) a mechanical anchor
(substantially-complete official count).

**Settlement update (DEEP-2026-08-25, RETRO-20260825-0637):** a later cycle
(2026-08-22 16:14Z) re-checked this same market ahead of the Aug23 vote and
found exactly what exception (a) requires — three converging polls (Auyl
5.1-7.3%; Respublica separately fighting the 5% threshold near 4.8%) —
recorded both legs `market-agrees` (forecasts 47ed7e39dade Auyl, 2c297b5fec4a
Respublica). Both settled exactly as the corroborated polling predicted:
Auyl WON 2nd place, Respublica LOST. Exception (a) is now a validated
predictor, n=1 country/instance — the ruled-out gate above stands unchanged
(still requires (a) or (b) to bypass it), this just confirms the exception
pays off when it actually fires rather than being untested.

**Managed-election centring note (RETRO-20260921-1120, Russia Duma Sep
18-20 2026).** In a managed election the state pollster's published
forecast understates the ruling party's official result: VCIOM forecast
41-44 pct vs 49.8 official in 2021, 51-53 vs about 58 in 2026. My UR seat
centre built from the 2026 forecast was 331; the preliminary count is 355.
That 24-seat undershoot, not the undefined baseline clause, is what put own
behind the book on the seat-GAIN legs (`23e8441da49c` own 0.25 vs mid
0.2035, `ac1d41a88c55` 0.05 vs 0.024, both lost; `5ece5e87793d` own No
0.35 vs mid 0.245, settled lost 2026-09-21 13:27Z, dB +0.0625; the event
closed 0 for 3 against the book, summed dB +0.0855, one draw)
and on the open UR seat brackets (`71dc5127a964`, `4c8153f75a72`). I had
applied the 2021 pollster miss to LDPR (overstated) and skipped the mirror
image for UR. Rule: a ruling-party share or seat estimate built from such a
forecast is centred at forecast-top plus the prior cycle's miss, with the
upside tail wider than the downside; if I cannot source the prior miss, the
book's bracket prices are the better centre and the row is `market-agrees`.
n=2 elections, one country: a centring rule for this family, not a betting
licence.
Settled 2026-09-25 11:42Z (RETRO-20260925-1207): the final UR total landed
in 340-354, below the 355 preliminary count. `71dc5127a964` (340-354, own
0.15 vs mid 0.24) WON, dB +0.1449; `4c8153f75a72` (355+, own 0.04 vs mid
0.055) LOST, dB -0.0014. The book's bracket prices beat my rough centre on
the leg that mattered, which is what this rule predicts: without a sourced
prior miss, the book is the centre.
Turnout legs settled 2026-09-25 13:49Z (RETRO-20260925-1421): official
turnout landed in 59-62 (preliminary 59.32). Bet `475edf2e2654` (62+ No,
own 0.94, entry 0.883) WON +$0.66, but only by about 2.7 points: my entry
centre (2021's 51.7 plus a reported 50 pct regional target) was 7 points
low, and the same undershoot put the 59-62 bracket forecast
`524586e795a1` (own 0.12 vs mid 0.152) behind the book, dB +0.0553. The
mid-election re-check `3873d4b596bb` (own No 0.55 vs mid 0.828, dB
+0.1729) overreacted the other way: it read a day-1 print that already
included the online votes as ordinary day-1 turnout. The front-loaded
online-vote model (53-58) was the closest of the four. Rules: (1) the
centring rule above applies to turnout too - the official figure sits
above the pollster's and the officials' stated targets, so centre at the
prior cycle's official figure plus the prior miss, not below it. (2) In a
multi-day vote with remote e-voting, the first print after the online
votes are added front-loads them; carry it forward with the front-loaded
model, not with an in-person day-1 ratio from a past cycle.

**Regional-sweep roster-check note (RETRO-20260925-1432, same Russia
Duma event, "United Russia wins every region" market).** Bet
`9074e3f2fd49` (own 0.76 vs ask 0.68) WON, beating the market (dB
-0.0448); the superseded first-pass forecast (own 0.62, market-agrees,
dB +0.0184) had priced in a tail risk from the 4 regions UR lost the
party-list plurality in during 2021 (Sakha, Mari El, Nenets AO,
Khabarovsk) without checking whether those regions were even on this
cycle's roster. The revision checked the actual 2026 39-region list and
found none of the 4 on it — the roster instead skewed toward
tightly-managed ethnic republics with a clean 2024/2025 sweep record —
and that narrower, checked read is what beat the market. Method to reuse
on the next regional/constituency-sweep market in a managed election:
when a prior cycle's exceptions are the basis for this cycle's tail-risk
estimate, check whether those exact regions/constituencies are in THIS
cycle's roster before carrying the risk forward — a historical exception
rate belongs to the specific units that produced it, not the country as
a whole. n=1, confirmed instance of an underused check, not a new gate.

**Exploration budget, Musk net-worth brackets (2026-08-19 04:xxZ, first
test; ruling recorded here by DEEP-2026-08-19 — the 04:20Z cycle logged it
only in funnel.jsonl/schedule.json, and rulings the pool re-check relies
on belong in this file).** Event 770193, 6 sibling $100B-wide brackets
settling Aug 31 (3213957-62), PM book internally well-calibrated (Yes-sum
~1.001, mode $800-900B at 0.35). The stated resolution source (Bloomberg
Billionaires Index Musk profile) WebFetch-403s (bot block, consistent with
every prior Bloomberg attempt), and the fallback cross-check produced a
~$300B same-day source-conflation spread ($675B Celebrity Net Worth;
$777B and $889B both attributed to Bloomberg within one search summary;
$744B stale Forbes contradicted by a same-day direct Forbes fetch showing
$879.2B; one $0.97T outlier tracker) against $100B-wide brackets — worse
than the HK-weather 3°C-vs-1°C-bracket precedent. No honest independent
bracket estimate is possible; `benchmark-unreachable`, no forecast, no
invented estimate. **Category ruled OUT while Bloomberg is unreachable
and no single corroborated proxy exists.** Revisit only if a reachable
proxy that the resolution source demonstrably tracks appears. Do NOT
conflate with the Musk tweet-count family (xtracker.polymarket.com),
which IS reachable and has its own standing characterization.

**Exploration budget, Iranian rial USD threshold brackets (2026-08-19
14:xxZ, first test).** New category: 7 sibling markets (3210162-64
range brackets, 3210203-06 touch-by-Aug31 brackets) resolving against
Bonbast.com's finalized free-market USD/IRR rate, Aug 31 deadline (~12
days out at test time), liquidity $47-$8.2k. Unlike the Musk/Kazakh
traps, the stated resolution source itself (Bonbast) is unambiguous and
WebSearch's AI-overview returned one internally consistent spot figure
(1,882,000 IRR/USD, +0.53% WoW) — no cross-source conflation this time.
The blocker is different: **the source isn't independently verifiable**.
A direct WebFetch of bonbast.com's live page returned the page shell
with no numeric rate in the extracted content (JS-rendered table), and
bon-bast.com/history 403'd (bot-blocked), so there is no way to pull an
actual multi-week series and check the WoW-change figure WebSearch
reported, let alone build the volatility estimate a 12-day multi-bracket
forecast needs (the JPM-$1T/gas-touch precedent shows naive vol models
only earn their keep when the vol input itself is trustworthy). Treating
one unverifiable AI-summarized number as an estimation input would be
the same failure class as the Kazakh/Musk conflation traps, just with
one source pretending to be many. `benchmark-unreachable` on all 7,
no forecast, no invented estimate. **Category ruled OUT pending either a
fetchable Bonbast endpoint (their `/webmaster` page advertises an API —
untried) or a corroborating second free-market IRR tracker** (alanchand.com
resolved separately in this test at a materially different rate,
1,897,000/1,878,000 sell/buy, ~1% off Bonbast's figure — plausibly a
different rate basis, not necessarily a conflict, but unverified either
way). Revisit only if the Bonbast API or an equivalent verifiable feed is
confirmed reachable.

**Drift before vol (RETRO-20261002-1545).** Forecast `7a016098059f` (USD
2.2M-2.5M IRR on Sep 30) recorded 0.90 from a zero-mean ~1.5%/day walk
around 2.34M. The rate had risen ~+0.45%/day for the prior month (2.10M
Aug 31 to 2.34M Sep 24) and settled in 2.5M-2.8M. A currency in a
sanctions or war depreciation trend is not a zero-mean walk: fit the
recent drift from at least two dated free-market prints, shift the
center by drift x days to the deadline, then apply vol. With drift that
row is ~0.80, not 0.90.

**Resolver-read conflict rule (RETRO-20261002-1620, evidence 7a016098059f).**
The Sep30 2.2-2.5M forecast was recorded at 0.90 on secondary trackers
(pashizi/alanchand ~2.31-2.34M) after a direct bonbast.com fetch read
207,350 toman (2.07M, below the band) and was dismissed as a stale JS read.
It resolved No. When ANY read of the named resolution source conflicts with
secondary trackers, the resolver read is not discarded: either reconcile it
(timestamp, basis) or weight it as at least a co-equal scenario in est_prob.
The category stays forecast-only under the 2026-08-19 ruling.

## Open-position monitoring (DEEP-2026-08-02)

Positions are held to resolution — never exited — but their live prices
are free information about the resolver. **REQUIRED line in every cycle
log, no exceptions** (sharpened DEEP-2026-08-03 after 10 of 19 cycles
silently skipped it — including 23:11Z, the cycle that placed
`84ec821167d5` and missed the start of its 0.14 collapse): for each open
position past its market end date, fetch the current book and log
`position id, entry, live bid/ask, mid, adverse move`; if none qualify,
log the literal line "open-position monitor: none past end date". Any
adverse move ≥ 0.10 from entry must be called out explicitly.
Evidence: `d2dd24206542` repriced from ~0.08 Yes at entry to ~0.545 Yes
over 2026-08-01/02 — 46 points against us on a thesis logged as
"structurally impossible" — and ~28 consecutive cycle logs repeated
"awaiting official resolution" without noticing. A sustained multi-day
adverse repricing on an unresolved market is resolver-process evidence
(dispute, rules reading we don't have) and feeds the position's eventual
grading; it is NOT a reason to exit (we can't) or to average in (ledger
forbids add-ons).

**Sign-check the direction (DEEP-2026-08-31, RETRO-20260831-1619):**
`quote.py` prices the exact token_id held. State the move as
`(live_mark_for_held_side − entry)`, signed. A held token's price
approaching 0 is ALWAYS adverse for that position (the market is pricing
the held side to lose), never favorable, no matter how small the absolute
number looks — do not eyeball "the ask is tiny" as "confirmed won." Prior
instance: the 12:55Z 2026-08-31 cycle logged the Tokyo-27°C No position
(entry 0.089) as "essentially confirmed won (ask now 0.001)" while ask
0.001 on the held No token in fact meant No was near-certain to lose; it
did, at −$5.00. Do the subtraction explicitly before characterizing a
move as favorable or adverse.

## Estimation method

1. Read the resolution criteria in the market description. Bet on what
   *resolves*, not what's likely in spirit.
2. Form an independent estimate BEFORE looking hard at the market price
   (anchoring guard). Write the estimate down in the rationale.
3. Identify the sharpest external benchmark (bookmaker odds, analyst
   consensus, base rates) and reconcile.
   - **Cross-venue divergence (added DEEP-2026-08-05, corrected 2026-08-05
     ~13:30Z after the operator's egress allowlist update):** a real-money
     venue pricing the same event (Kalshi, CME FedWatch for Fed decisions) is
     a benchmark at least as good as a devigged bookmaker line. Direct API
     fetch to `api.elections.kalshi.com` now returns 200 from this runner
     (was 403 before the 2026-08-05 10:53Z allowlist change) — use
     `strategy/tools/kalshi.py events --series-ticker <t>` /
     `markets --series-ticker <t>` (or `--event-ticker`) to pull live
     yes/no bid-ask directly, no auth needed for public market data. Check
     BOTH sides' bid/ask, not just one side's ask, before calling it a
     divergence — and confirm the Kalshi and Polymarket contracts settle on
     the same terms (same strike/threshold, same official source) before
     treating a price gap as edge rather than a definitional mismatch.
     `api.manifold.markets` is also 200 now but Manifold stays play-money —
     reference only, never a benchmark. `www.metaculus.com/api2` is STILL 403
     even with the allowlist (site-side bot block, confirmed from a
     residential IP too) — for Metaculus, WebSearch for the venue's pricing
     by name (e.g. "Kalshi Fed rate decision September odds") is still the
     only channel, same pattern as sportsbook odds coverage.
   - **Kalshi has a per-1%-bracket "Above X%" ladder for the unemployment
     rate, series `KXU3-<YY><MON>` (2026-08-06 15:41Z finding, not the same
     series as the payrolls/CPI ladders already validated 2026-08-05
     13:45Z).** Differencing adjacent `Above` contracts gives an implied
     point distribution to compare against Polymarket's own bracket set —
     for July 2026 it disagreed with PM's internal ranking (Kalshi peaked
     4.2% at ~0.32 with 4.1%≈0.21/4.3%≈0.28; PM priced 4.3% highest at 0.335
     with 4.1% close behind at 0.295, understating 4.2% and overstating
     4.1%/4.3% by several points each vs the Kalshi-implied numbers). Real
     divergence, but PM's per-bracket books on this cluster are thin and
     wide (0.07-0.10 spread on the 4.1%/4.3% legs, `journal/ledger.jsonl`-
     verified via `quote.py`) — over `max_spread` (0.06), a hard veto for a
     benchmark-derived bet (Spread-rule scope below), so the divergence is
     unreachable, not exploitable. Log this as a distinct benchmark-reachable-
     but-book-too-wide skip, and re-check the ladder near the 2026-08-07
     08:30Z BLS release in case the book tightens.
     **Recheck (2026-08-06 19:13Z, ~13h before release):** book tightened to
     0.05 spread (now under `max_spread`) — the wide-book veto no longer
     applies, but the edge itself doesn't clear the bar: best ask-edge across
     the 4.0-4.3% legs is only 0.021-0.03 (4.1% No highest at 0.025, 4.3% No
     at 0.03), under `min_edge` 0.04. The divergence direction is unchanged
     from 15:41Z; it was never blocked on spread alone once you do the actual
     ask-edge arithmetic — say so accurately next time rather than defaulting
     to "unreachable." **`kalshi.py` usage note:** `markets --series-ticker
     KXU3-26JUL` silently returns nothing — `KXU3-26JUL` is the *event*
     ticker, not the series ticker (the series is just `KXU3`, spanning all
     months). Use `markets --event-ticker KXU3-26JUL` to scope to one month's
     ladder; `--series-ticker KXU3` returns all months unscoped. The tool
     itself is correct (verified against the raw API this cycle); this was a
     call-site error worth remembering so it doesn't cost another cycle.
     **Outcome graded (DEEP-2026-08-08): July printed 4.1%** (FRED UNRATE,
     2026-07-01 row, pulled directly). Both venues' modes were wrong —
     Kalshi-implied peak 4.2% (~0.32), PM peak 4.3% (0.335) — so the
     divergence the six-check thread was chasing was two thin, wrong
     distributions disagreeing, not information. The noise-read skips were
     validated concretely: the final pre-release candidate (4.1% No at
     edge 0.04, exactly at min_edge, 07:30Z) was on the wrong side of the
     print and would have lost. Rule: **a Kalshi-vs-PM price divergence is
     a benchmark only when one side has a mechanical anchor** (official
     nowcast, arithmetic on published components); two order books
     disagreeing about the same unknown is a spread, not an edge — trade
     it only with an independent estimate of the underlying, held to the
     same standards as any other estimate. Honest caveat: my own
     fair-value lean pointed away from the outcome (read 4.1% as
     overpriced at ~0.295), so the discipline saved a loss the estimate
     would have taken. n=1; grade the next ladder print the same way.
   - **Devig with `strategy/tools/devig.py`, and use the POWER number for any
     side priced below ~0.60.** Proportional (divide-by-sum) devig spreads
     the vig evenly, but books load vig onto longshots (favorite-longshot
     bias) — at typical 5-7% overrounds it inflates the cheap side by
     ~0.5-1.5 cents (Sun ML +144: proportional 0.390 vs power 0.381), a
     quarter-to-a-third of a 0.04 "edge". All 7 losing bets of
     2026-07-30/31 bought the cheaper side (0.34-0.52) off proportional
     devigs (DEEP-2026-07-31).
   - **Check line freshness before calling a divergence an edge.** Scraped
     aggregators lag; PM sports makers don't. If ANY book already matches
     PM's number, or reports are mixed, assume PM reflects the current line
     and the gap is a line move you saw late — not edge. Evidence:
     `8e67cf4882bc` (entry note said "one book 4.5" while betting against
     -4.5; Sky covered) and `1436bb727464` (aggregator "consensus 188-189"
     vs PM 185.5; Under hit).
   - **Same-day-deadline WebSearch timing (2026-09-01, the Mythos-class
     "by-date" family).** A "no confirmed announcement yet" WebSearch read
     on a market resolving "by end of day X," with an active credible
     rumor of an imminent event, is weak evidence for No while day X
     hasn't fully elapsed — it can just mean the event hasn't happened
     YET, or has happened but hasn't reached my search index yet, not that
     it won't happen today. Evidence: 3 of 5 outside-view-veto forecasts on
     the Mythos-release-by-date family (`720781176db9`/`237402dd3f1e` est
     No 0.80/0.94, `f9a6e09224dd` est No 0.88) were checked hours before
     Anthropic's official Sep1 announcement, all LOST (counterfactual
     ledger below) — the announcement landed later that SAME calendar day.
     No capital was risked (fact-finality gate vetoes rumor-based edges
     regardless), so this cost nothing, but the estimate itself was
     overconfident on "No" for the wrong reason. For a same-day deadline
     with a live imminent-event rumor, re-check close to the actual cutoff
     before finalizing a low P(Yes) — one morning search isn't enough.
   - **Quote the live bid/ask inside the rationale itself, not a number
     carried over from earlier the same cycle (2026-09-04, Astra by-date
     family, RETRO-20260904-2215).** Three outside-view-veto rows
     recorded in one research pass (`99d1545b2ec7`/`7adc67fe86cc`/
     `b249eb7256a0`, by-Sep4/5/6) wrote rationales claiming mkt Yes
     ~0.14/0.315/0.36 and edges of 0.06–0.135, "under/near the 0.10
     gate" — but the `best_bid_at_record`/`best_ask_at_record` fields
     `forecast.py` actually stamped on those SAME calls read
     0.862/0.864, 0.68/0.69, 0.63/0.65: the market had already repriced
     to 64–86% Yes by the time these were recorded, a same-day move the
     rationale never reflected. Graded against the true recorded book
     the edges were 0.36–0.78, not marginal, and the market was right
     (all three resolved Yes). Before finalizing any veto/no-edge
     rationale, write the exact bid/ask about to be passed to
     `forecast.py`/`ledger.py` into the note itself; if it has moved
     sharply since the last check on the same market this cycle, that
     move IS the signal to re-search before recording a number, not
     noise to write past.
   - **Count sources by underlying primary origin, not by search hits
     (DEEP-2026-09-02; pre-registered as a watch item at the Alibaba
     forecast's recording, settled evidence now cited).** Multiple
     WebSearch hits that all proxy the SAME nominal primary source are one
     observation, not independent confirmation. Evidence: Alibaba
     best-Chinese-model (`a467140e14e7`, est 0.78 vs mkt 0.944) — three
     separate web reads all restated the same arena.ai leaderboard
     snapshot, treated as convergent support for fading a 0.94 favorite;
     resolved WITH the market, −1.00u counterfactual. Same shape in the
     Mythos by-date family (RETRO-20260901-2222): five deadline legs
     re-confirmed off one underlying release rumor were "not 5 independent
     confirmations — one correlated signal," 0W/5L counterfactual. Before
     writing "multiple sources agree" in a rationale, name the distinct
     primary origins; if they collapse to one, the estimate gets one
     source's worth of confidence.
4. Only bet when |my estimate − fill price| ≥ the min edge for the edge
   class (`min_edge` for structural, `min_edge_book_devig` for book-devig
   arbitration) AND I can name the specific reason the market is wrong.
   "I feel it's mispriced" is not a reason.
   - **A literal source-reading vs a >0.90 market consensus is a resolver-
     process red flag, not just a confident fact.** Evidence (2026-07-31):
     `7e753de88823` (Moonshot Yes) bet that a named leaderboard source
     showed Moonshot on top; the operator verified that exact source
     directly, three times spanning 22h including 2.5h *after* resolution,
     and it never moved off the same reading — yet the market resolved the
     other way, at ~93% confidence priced in advance. The market's price
     predicted the resolution better than the literal source read did. When
     your reading of a resolution-relevant source disagrees with a >0.90
     consensus, that consensus likely embeds something about HOW the
     resolver reads the source (which table/toggle/view, dispute
     precedent) that a fact-only check doesn't capture. Before betting
     against that kind of consensus, name specifically what the crowd
     might be missing about the *resolution process* — not just re-confirm
     the fact. This applies to resolution reads requiring a judgment call
     (UI settings, which mirror/table); it does not apply to mechanical
     resolution sources (a number printed in an official filing/API),
     which aren't implicated by this evidence.
   - **Outside-view veto on large claimed edges (DEEP-2026-08-07).** The
     settled record splits cleanly on claimed edge size: bets claiming
     edge > 0.10 are **0W/5L, -$25, brier_delta +0.4587** (agent brier
     0.5714 vs market 0.1127 — catastrophically worse than the market:
     `7e753de88823` 0.535, `0bf9fe3785c6` 0.617, `b21e42c123a1` 0.75,
     `84ec821167d5` 0.49, `d6d71ab454dc` 0.17); bets claiming edge ≤ 0.10
     are 6W/8L with brier_delta **+0.0041** — market-level. All five
     large-edge bets were interpretive forecasts where I held NO
     information the market lacked (a UI-toggle reading, two war-news
     readings, a box-office press reading, an intraday-volatility
     extrapolation from public spot data). Mechanism, not just small-n
     correlation: on a liquid book, a 15-75 point disagreement with the
     price is far more likely to be my model missing something than the
     entire market missing something. Rule: before placing any bet with
     claimed edge > 0.10, write down the specific fact or arithmetic the
     market structurally CANNOT have priced (an official number already
     published, a cross-market inconsistency computable from live books).
     "My forecast disagrees with the price" never qualifies. If no such
     fact exists, either shrink the estimate toward the market until the
     edge is ordinary, or skip. (The 0.10 boundary is post-hoc at n=19 —
     treat it as a red-flag trigger for this test, not a proven numeric
     threshold; the test itself is the rule.)
   - **Same-day commodity price-threshold bets on a live geopolitical
     conflict complex: don't extrapolate "realized range so far" as a
     volatility bound (DEEP-2026-08-06).** `d6d71ab454dc` (WTI closes above
     $77) estimated P(Yes)=0.12 mid-day from "needed move ($1-2.4) exceeds
     realized range so far (~$1.40)" plus a same-day bearish catalyst
     (Iran/Strait-of-Hormuz deal hopes) — WTI closed $77.75 (+3.37% on the
     day), the tail move happened, in the opposite direction of the cited
     catalyst. This contract sits on the same US-Iran conflict complex as
     `d2dd24206542` (a ceasefire position that has itself round-tripped
     0.92→0.14→0.20+ on headline swings) — that complex produces discrete
     headline-driven jumps, not bounded continuation from a mid-day
     snapshot. n=1, not enough for a numeric floor, but treat "range so
     far" reasoning on conflict-linked commodities as unreliable; either
     discount confidence well below what the range-based math implies, or
     require a catalyst check close to the actual close rather than hours
     before it.
   - **Mirror case, close-above rows recorded hours ahead on a day that is
     already moving (RETRO-20260922-0015).** `1753e8464def` (WTI closes
     above $91 on Sep 21) estimated 0.92 at 11:21Z from a 14-day realized
     daily sd (2.6%) with the price 2.8% above the barrier and 7 hours to
     the settle. The day delivered about -8.5% (a 3-sd day by that window)
     and printed a low 0.19 above the barrier; the 17:33Z supersede at 0.78,
     scaled from the day's own hourly range, was the calibrated number and
     matched the market. Rule: when the day's move already exceeds about
     2 window-sds at record time, the multi-day window is stale for the
     rest of that session. Scale the remaining-session sd from the larger
     of the window sd and the day's own realized range, and shade further
     when the move is directional toward the barrier. Together with the
     DEEP-2026-08-06 bullet: neither "range so far" nor a quiet-day window
     bounds a conflict-linked commodity on a moving day; take the wider
     of the two, and prefer superseding close to the settle over a single
     read hours out. Both rows won, so this is a calibration lesson
     (own Brier 0.0064 vs market 0.0042 on the early row), not a P&L one.
5. **Check the live book first** (`python3 strategy/tools/quote.py
   <clob_token_id>`, token ids are in scan output; if the sandbox blocks it,
   `curl -s "https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id=<id>" -o work/book_<x>.json`
   and read the file — fetch into `work/` not `/tmp`; the sandbox blocks
   reading `/tmp` (learned 2026-07-30 cycle 3). `work/` is gitignored
   (operator-notes 2026-08-31 ~21:30Z), so no manual cleanup is needed before
   committing. `scan.py` outcome_prices are stale mids; fills happen
   at the best ask. Apply `min_edge` to the ASK, not the scan price.
   Evidence (2026-07-30 cycle): REF "No" scan mid 0.833 → ask 0.999
   (rejected); NG "Up" scan mid 0.915 → filled 0.95, edge collapsed to 0.02;
   WTI "Down" scan mid 0.926 → best ask 0.98 vs est 0.97 (negative edge,
   skipped). Stale mids cut BOTH ways: Corinthians win scan mid 0.455 →
   live book 0.42/0.43 (2026-07-30 cycle 4) — a marginal-looking edge on
   the mid can be a qualifying edge at the ask, so check the book before
   discarding near-threshold candidates too.

6. **One position per market+outcome** — the ledger rejects add-ons even at a
   better price (2026-07-30 cycle 5: Corinthians Yes re-entry at 0.42 vs held
   0.43 rejected). If new evidence strengthens a held position, capture the
   edge via a correlated sibling market instead: e.g. holding "Team A win Yes",
   the extra edge showed up in "Team B win No" (devig 0.78 vs ask 0.74) —
   sibling 1X2 legs are priced independently enough to diverge.
   Sharpened (DEEP-2026-07-31) — know which pair type you're building:
   - **Hedge-like pair** (e.g. "A win Yes" + "B win No": a draw splits them):
     partial offset, acceptable. Evidence: `2c4c6a2adc0a`+`1e8dec1078ba`
     went 1W/1L on a draw, net -$3.24.
   - **Same-direction pair** (e.g. "A win No" + "B win Yes": both lose if A
     wins): this is doubled event exposure, not extra edge capture. Only
     take it when each leg independently clears its edge threshold, and
     never exceed `risk.json max_stake_per_event_usd` on one underlying
     event. Evidence: `821d54f6b7c8`+`53283a95e7bb` (open) — $10 rides on
     "Bucaramanga doesn't win".
   - Retros must grade a correlated pair as ONE decision (net P&L per
     event), not as independent wins/losses.
   - **Event definition + correlation logging (DEEP-2026-09-09).** For
     `max_stake_per_event_usd`, an "event" is one real-world resolution
     trigger: one game, one print, one ruling, one election night. Legs
     on the same trigger count toward the cap ONLY if pairwise
     positively correlated (both lose on the same realization of the
     trigger); an explicitly hedging leg does not count against it, but
     the hedge claim must be argued in the rationale AT ENTRY, with the
     sign of correlation to each existing open leg on that trigger.
     Evidence forcing the definition: the 2026-09-13 Swedish election
     now carries three open No-side legs (e746d7e1ba99 Andersson-PM,
     09fc471ceec1 SD-second-most, b063db346052 Liberals-threshold, $15
     total). Credit where due: the hourly agent DID argue the pairwise
     signs at entry in the schedule.json watch items (L-No negatively
     correlated with Andersson-No, SD-vs-M bloc-neutral/negligible) —
     the analysis was done; what was missing was any rule saying the
     cap turns on it, so whether $15 on one election night was
     compliant was undecidable from risk.json alone. Under this
     definition it is compliant: no pair is cleanly same-direction
     (L-No partially hedges Andersson-No via ~14 right-bloc seats;
     SD-vs-M is inner-bloc). Pre-registered:
     grade the trio at settlement as ONE event-night decision (net P&L,
     plus whether a common polling-error factor moved all three), per
     the schedule.json watch item. The trio stays on; the rule is
     forward-looking.

## Forecast ledger: what it can and cannot test (DEEP-2026-08-10)

**Sign convention is the instrument's, always (DEEP-2026-08-21):
`brier_delta = brier_agent − brier_market`, NEGATIVE = agent beat the
market** (score.py's own docstring, and how every score slice prints).
Three retros in one window (RETRO-20260820-2012, RETRO-20260821-0212,
RETRO-20260821-0413) quoted "brier_delta" with the sign flipped
(positive = beat the mid) — each individually harmless because the prose
said which side won, but a slice claim assembled from those retros later
would be sign-corrupted, the same failure family as the stale hand-carried
No-side subtotals (2026-08-18/19). When writing any retro number named
`brier_delta`, copy it from score.py output, don't recompute with your own
sign; if quoting "how much I beat the mid by", call it something else.

First scored window (2026-08-09/10): 54 forecasts recorded, 18 settled,
brier_delta +0.001 (z -0.15) — estimates that agree with the market settle
at market. Reassuring, and expected by construction. Three durable rules
from the window:

1. **The disagreement gap is the number to watch, not aggregate
   brier_delta.** Only 6 of 55 recorded rows carry ask-edge ≥ 0.02
   (3 politics, 2 econ, 1 earnings — ZERO sports), and none has settled;
   the threshold sweep is empty. Sports-devig forecasts structurally
   cannot test disagreement calibration: the estimate (devigged book
   consensus) and PM's price are downstream of the same books, so
   agreement is baked in. Only independent-source estimates — polls,
   official prints, consensus EPS, count extrapolations — produce rows
   where est and price genuinely differ. When allocating research
   minutes, weigh a candidate partly by whether it can ADD a
   disagreement row, since that is the only stream that will ever answer
   "are we calibrated when we disagree?".
   **No-side blind spot CLOSED (2026-08-24 actioned, DEEP-2026-08-14
   proposal):** score.py now reports `threshold_sweep_no` alongside the
   Yes-side `threshold_sweep` (complement edge `best_bid_at_record -
   est_prob`, filled at `1 - best_bid`; rows lacking `best_bid_at_record`
   are skipped and counted). First run on the full journal (2026-08-24):
   the No-side stream is materially better-behaved than the Yes-side one
   at every matched threshold — e.g. edge≥0.10: Yes n=7 win=0.00
   brier_delta=+0.1176 (total loss) vs No n=11 win=0.55 pnl=-0.05u
   brier_delta=+0.0190 (near flat); edge≥0.05: Yes brier_delta=+0.0531 vs
   No brier_delta=+0.0313. Both sides are still net-negative brier_delta
   (behind market when disagreeing), but the earlier "zero settled
   evidence when disagreeing" framing was a Yes-side-only artifact — the
   No-side stream shows disagreement calibration closer to the market's
   than the Yes-side stream does. Note the sweep grades ALL settled
   forecasts at recorded prices, not the same population as the
   hand-kept realizable counterfactual-veto table below, so figures will
   not match that table row for row. Retros citing "the sweep" from now
   on must say which side.
2. **Record even when declining — especially when declining.** The
   outside-view veto (>0.10 claimed edge) would be unfalsifiable if
   declined estimates were never scored. The 2026-08-10 declines (PLBY
   claimed 0.14; WI Hong ≥30% bracket claimed 0.117) are both recorded
   as forecasts, so the veto gets out-of-sample grading at zero bankroll
   cost. **Pre-registered (grade in the next deep retros, explicitly):**
   WI Hong brackets (settle ~Aug 11) and PLBY (Aug 10 night) — declined
   side loses ⇒ veto validated; declined side would have won ⇒ first
   evidence the veto over-fires. CPI rows (Aug 12) grade the econ pivot.
   **PLBY graded (DEEP-2026-08-11): veto validated, instance one.** Yes
   resolved No; the declined bet (est 0.33 vs ask 0.19, claimed edge
   0.14) would have lost $5. Nuance worth keeping: the 04:16Z revised
   estimate (0.33) was WORSE against the outcome than the stale 00:23Z
   row (0.28) — a re-verification that "confirms a real signal" can
   still move the number the wrong way, which is why revised-away rows
   should be scored as their own slice if revision support lands
   (journal/proposals.md 2026-08-10). Still pre-registered, settling
   2026-08-11 night: WI Hong brackets (claimed edges to 0.117), SC
   Nordone (claimed 0.27) / Fry (claimed 0.196) / Norman, MN Craig
   (claimed 0.15) / Flanagan. The next deep retro grades EVERY one of
   these rows explicitly — each is veto-validated or veto-over-fires;
   an over-fire (Fry or Craig hitting) reopens the well-evidenced-
   polling-exception question at a measured foregone cost.
   **GRADED (DEEP-2026-08-12, provisional — on-chain prices near-certain,
   UMA resolution pending): zero over-fires; every decided disagreement
   went to the market. Row-by-row table and the durable primaries rule in
   the "Primary batch graded" section below.**
3. **Revision support ACTIONED (2026-08-24, DEEP-2026-08-10 proposal):**
   `forecast.py record --supersede` now replaces the live open forecast
   on a market+outcome when the read has materially changed (|delta
   est_prob| >= 0.05, or a changed skip-reason); rows are linked
   (`supersedes` / `superseded_by`), anti-flooding still fires without
   the flag or without a material change. The superseded row stays open
   and still settles, but score.py grades it in a separate
   `revised_away` slice, not the headline stats or the threshold sweeps
   — whether revisions improve estimates is measured, not assumed. Use
   `--supersede` (not the funnel-note workaround) whenever a
   re-verification materially changes an open forecast — e.g. the open
   AfD Sachsen-Anhalt read (de95e5168de3 / forecast row) as the polls
   move before its ~Sep4-5 re-check.

**Exploration budget, low-media-coverage international elections (2026-08-10
~14:5xZ, first test of this category).** Hypothesis: "national elections
outside the US/UK/major-EU set have the same WebSearch-reachable polling
infrastructure as domestic races." Zambia's 2026-08-13 presidential election
(Hichilema vs Mundubile, PM prices Hichilema 0.91): every findable number was
either a self-selected Facebook/online poll (55/35, 50/45) or a partisan
domestic outlet's house prediction (Lusaka Times, Zambian Observer) — no
Afrobarometer, Ipsos, or comparable scientific-sample poll turned up.
Directionally unanimous (all sources favor Hichilema by a wide margin,
consistent with PM's price), but not precise or credible enough to
independently benchmark a specific probability — treated as
benchmark-unreachable, no forecast recorded (honest-estimate rule: don't
invent a number from unscientific sources). Category result: **reachable
only for directional confirmation, not for a point estimate** — the opposite
failure mode from the UK-GDP contradictory-single-sources case (there,
credible sources disagreed; here, only non-credible sources exist at all).
Revisit on an internationally-polled race (Afrobarometer-covered country,
or one with an Economist/YouGov country tracker) before generalizing further
to this category.

**UK Q2 GDP re-check, one day pre-release (2026-08-11 06:xxZ) — two new red
flags beyond the 08-08/08-10 contradictory-forecast finding.** (1) The
sibling set (`siblings.py` on event 486133, 7 legs: negative, 0-0.1%,
0.2-0.3%, 0.4-0.5%, 0.6-0.7%, 0.8-0.9%, >=1.0%) has unexplained GAPS —
0.1-0.2%, 0.3-0.4%, 0.5-0.6%, 0.7-0.8%, 0.9-1.0% have no corresponding
market at all, so a print landing in one of those bands would apparently
make every listed sibling resolve No simultaneously. Either Polymarket
defines an implicit rounding/bucketing rule not stated in any one market's
description, or the bracket set is genuinely incomplete — don't treat the
7-leg sum-check (1.0695, normal-looking vig) as informative until this is
understood, since a sum computed over a non-exhaustive partition means
nothing. (2) Each market's own resolution text says it resolves off the
**"Second quarterly estimate, UK"** release "scheduled for August 12,
2026," but links to the ONS's `gdpfirstquarterlyestimateuk` bulletin page,
and a fresh WebSearch (Berenberg's Andrew Wishart, named source, Q2 growth
"0.3% or 0.4%" barring a weak June) independently found the *first*
quarterly estimate is scheduled for **August 13**, not the 12th — first
vs. second estimate is a real distinction (different data vintage) and the
date named in the market contradicts external reporting on the actual ONS
calendar. Compounding: Berenberg's 0.3-0.4% point sits exactly in one of
the undefined gaps above. Two independent ambiguities (which release, and
whether the brackets even partition the outcome space) on top of the
already-known forecast disagreement — treated as `ambiguous-resolution`,
not `benchmark-unreachable` (the earlier framing): even a perfect
benchmark wouldn't tell me which bracket wins here. No forecast recorded.
If revisited after the release actually lands, check which day it
actually printed on and whether an off-grid GDP value produced a NO sweep
across all listed brackets — that would confirm or refute the gap-bucket
reading with real data at zero cost.

**Post-release grading (DEEP-2026-08-14) — test run, result inconclusive,
item CLOSED.** The hourly cycles dropped this watch item (no cycle after
2026-08-11 23:24Z touched it — third instance of the no-carrier failure,
see schedule.json `watch_items`); the deep retro ran it: event 486133 is
fully resolved, **0.4-0.5% bracket Yes, all six other legs No** (gamma,
umaResolutionStatus resolved on every leg). The print landed on-grid, so
the gap-bucket hypothesis (off-grid print ⇒ all-No sweep) was never
exercised — untested, not confirmed. The abstention cost nothing (no
bettable structure either way), and the first-vs-second-estimate date
ambiguity evidently did not prevent clean resolution. Carry the lesson,
not the item: bracket sets with undefined gaps stay `ambiguous-resolution`
until a listed bracket is priced wrong on its own terms.

## PPI YoY brackets: base-effect projection, first instance (2026-08-11)

New category, econ-ppi (never researched before this cycle; scan's econ-tag
query surfaced only 3 of the event's 10 sibling brackets, same
discovery-gap shape already seen repeatedly on CPI — full set only
recoverable by pulling the gamma event directly). Method for projecting
next month's YoY print from the current one: `YoY_next(NSA) ≈
YoY_current(NSA) × (1+MoM_next_consensus) / (1+MoM_sameMonthLastYear_actual)
− 1`. This works because the 12-month change is NSA but a same-calendar-
month seasonal factor cancels between the two years, so chaining forward
with SA consensus MoM figures (the only ones publicly forecast) is a valid
approximation, not a basis mismatch — confirmed by cross-checking the BLS
release text explicitly labels the 12-month change "not seasonally
adjusted" and MoM "seasonally adjusted" (bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm).
Applied to July 2026: Jun26 YoY 5.5% NSA (BLS-confirmed) × Jul26 MoM
consensus +0.1% (tradingeconomics) / Jul25 MoM actual +0.9% (an unusually
hot print rolling out of the base) ⇒ central estimate ~4.7% NSA, wide of
the market's own apparent mode. Practical notes for reuse:

1. **Needs the actual (not just consensus-implied) same-month-last-year
   MoM** — this is where the edge came from (Jul25's atypical +0.9% MoM
   makes Jul26 YoY decelerate faster than a naive "MoM stays flat"
   read would suggest). Skipping this step is the most likely way to get
   the method wrong.
2. **SD calibration is thin** (n=2: May consensus-miss +0.4pp, June
   -0.3pp) — used sd=0.45pp, deliberately on the wide/conservative side.
   Revisit once more monthly misses are observed.
3. **This event's book was bumpy/non-monotonic across adjacent 0.1pt
   brackets** (Yes prices ...0.073, 0.168, 0.0485... not smoothly
   decreasing away from the mode) and summed to ~1.14 — a thinner,
   less-arbitraged book than the CPI event. Several legs showed large
   nominal model-vs-market disagreement (5.3%, 5.4%, ≥6.0% all >0.10
   apparent edge) but all had spread > max_spread 0.06 — wide-book veto
   applied and declined regardless of edge size, per the DEEP-2026-08-07
   large-claimed-edge caution. Only the `<=5.1%` leg had a tight book
   (spread 0.02) and a sub-0.10 edge (0.06) — that's the one bet placed.
4. **Pre-registered for grading**: settles with the Aug 13 08:30 ET BLS
   PPI release. First out-of-sample test of this technique — do not
   reuse it confidently on other econ-print brackets (CPI, PCE, etc.)
   until this one grades.

**Graded (DEEP-2026-08-13, RETRO-20260813-1707): WON.** July PPI printed
inside the ≤5.1% NSA YoY bucket as the projection estimated; the bet leg
(`b35963f465b4`, est 0.84 vs ask 0.78) settled +1.41, and all nine sibling
forecast legs (5.2% through ≥6.0%, est_prob 0.00-0.05) correctly resolved
lost, confirming the whole distribution shape, not just the one bucket.
n=1 event — this clears the pre-registration bar (reuse with the same
small-n caution as the sd=0.45pp calibration note above, not yet a proven
technique) but is not a track record; do not port to CPI/PCE brackets
without separately checking the sibling book's mode against the projected
central estimate each time.

**Correction (DEEP-2026-08-14) to RETRO-20260813-1707's counterfactual
claim.** That retro stated the two wide-spread-vetoed sibling legs (5.3%,
≥6.0%) "would have lost had they been bet, reconfirming that veto." Wrong
side: the model's apparent edge on both legs was **No-side** (the funnel
notes themselves say "large No-side edge"). Redone with fill arithmetic:
5.3% (5ad483698a95, bid/ask 0.133/0.209) — No ask 0.867 vs model No
0.964, realizable edge 0.097, and the bracket resolved No, so a $5 No bet
would have **WON ≈ +$0.77**; ≥6.0% (4908388c9fd7, bid/ask 0.003/0.08) —
No ask 0.997 vs model No 0.9973, edge ≈0.0003, **no realizable trade**
(the apparent edge vs the mid evaporates crossing the spread — which is
the actual justification of the spread veto on that leg). Net: the
wide-spread veto's settled counterfactual record here is 1 missed win +
1 correct non-trade, not 2 saves. Rule for future retros: counterfactuals
get the same arithmetic as real fills — side, realizable ask, spread —
never a narrative verdict.

## Primary batch graded (DEEP-2026-08-12, provisional pending UMA)

The largest pre-registered disagreement batch on record settled on-chain
overnight (WI/SC/MN primaries, 2026-08-11). Grading is against live gamma
prices at 04:4xZ Aug 12 — SC and MN legs are at 0.99+, effectively decided;
the WI *winner* is genuinely uncalled (Crowley +0.4pp with ~87% counted,
market ~0.90/0.07), but every margin bracket ≥5% is decided No regardless of
winner since the realized margin is under 1pp either way. Finalize at UMA
resolution; nothing below is expected to flip except possibly the WI winner
legs and the Hong-by-<5% bracket, which are explicitly NOT graded.

**Official settlements trickling in (DEEP-2026-08-13):** three
politics-primary forecast rows have now settled on-chain via resolve.py
(score.py politics-primary n=3, brier_delta +0.1109), including SC Fry
(officially LOST, matching the provisional grade). Every official
settlement so far matches its provisional grade; the batch's remaining
rows are among the 31 open forecasts. No re-grading needed unless a WI
leg resolves against its provisional call.

| Row (forecast est vs mkt at record) | Outcome | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| SC Nordone round-1 No lean (0.33 vs 0.595, claimed 0.27 — largest ever) | Nordone WON (0.99) | veto validated #2: $5 No bet would have lost |
| SC Fry round-1 Yes (0.27 vs 0.0705, claimed 0.196) | Fry LOST (0.003) | veto validated #3 |
| MN Craig nominee Yes (0.45 vs 0.295, claimed 0.15) | Craig LOST (0.0005) | veto validated #4 |
| MN Flanagan nominee No lean (0.52 vs 0.715, claimed ~0.195) | Flanagan WON (0.9995) | veto validated #5 |
| WI Hong ≥30% margin Yes (0.23 vs 0.10, claimed ~0.12) | margin <1pp ⇒ No | veto validated #6 |
| WI Hong 25–30% / 20–25% (0.22 vs 0.135 / 0.24 vs 0.1845) | No | veto validated (same model, counted with #6) |
| MN Gov Lindell lean (no forecast row — declined to estimate, 2026-08-09 pre-registration) | Demuth WON (0.9995) | confirmation per its own pre-registration |
| SC Norman (0.32 vs 0.325, no-edge) | Norman LOST | at-market, no signal |
| WI low brackets <5%/5–10%/15–20% (est below mkt) | ≥5% ones No | agent leaned righter, but same model that missed everything else — no credit claimed |

Aggregate over the 13 forecast rows (provisional outcomes): agent brier
≈0.174 vs market ≈0.116, delta ≈ +0.058 — the market decisively better,
concentrated exactly in the large-claimed-edge rows. **The outside-view veto
is now 6-for-6 with zero over-fires (PLBY + these five), all at zero
bankroll cost.** The line-511 question ("well-evidenced polling exception in
low-candidate-count primaries?") is answered: NO exception. The SC internal
poll had Fry "narrowly ahead" — he got ~3% of the market's final price; the
two aligned WI polls had Hong +24 — realized margin under 1pp.

**The WI twist cuts deeper than "market right, agent wrong": the market was
wrong too.** PM had Hong ~0.89-0.92 to win from Aug 7 through Aug 10;
Crowley now leads. The polls-to-margin model normal(mean 24, sd 8) put est
0.01 on "Hong by <5%" — reality landed at ±0.5pp, a beyond-99th-percentile
miss of the model's own distribution. Low-turnout primaries are a category
where sparse polling has no predictive validity AND the market price itself
can be badly wrong — deference to the market here is not a safe harbor,
it's just a cheaper way to be wrong.

**Durable rule (contested primaries):** in contested-primary win/margin
markets, polling-derived independent estimates are not bettable at any
claimed edge (0-for-6 record above), and market-agrees positions are not
safe either (WI). The category is research/forecast-only — record forecasts
to keep measuring, never bet, unless the estimate has a mechanical anchor
(e.g. substantially-complete official count with the market lagging it).
Uncontested or landslide-polling primaries with the market already at 0.9+
stay in the no-edge bucket they already occupy.

**Extension to general elections (DEEP-2026-08-13, scope clarification —
not new evidence):** the bar applies to ANY election win/margin market
where the estimate has no numeric, methodologically-credible polling and
no mechanical anchor — qualitative "expected to win" framing, however
unanimous across outlets, is the same evidence shape that went 0-for-6 in
the primaries. The 04:14Z 2026-08-13 cycle already applied this by
extension on Zambia (fa185b55a5c3, est 0.87 vs ask 0.93, declined —
correct call, wrong skip label, see §Skip-reason taxonomy `category-bar`);
this paragraph makes the extension a rule so future declines don't need
to re-derive it. Zambia was the first out-of-sample test of whether the
bar's logic generalizes beyond primaries. **Settled (2026-08-18 18:16Z,
RETRO-20260818-1816): Yes, market right (ask 0.93), model's 0.87 discount
wrong — same evidence shape (qualitative "expected to win" framing, no
numeric poll) as the primaries, same result (market beat the discounted
estimate).** n=1 out-of-sample, consistent with but not by itself proof of
generalization; the extension rule stands, confirmed rather than untested.
Elections WITH credible
numeric polling (Afrobarometer/Ipsos-class, or an Economist/YouGov
tracker) are outside the bar and go through the normal estimation path;
the WI lesson (market-agrees is no safe harbor) still applies there.
Settled record of that carve-out (RETRO-20260907-1006): n=2 instances,
both correct. Kazakh Auyl/Respublica (Aug 23, three converging polls,
market-agrees, 2W/0L) and Sachsen-Anhalt AfD majority (Sep 6, dawum
tracker + politpro seat model, bet WON, brier_delta -0.0315; see §First
bet in 13 days for the seat-model family ruling). The carve-out stands
as written; two instances do not widen it.

**Another confirming instance of the durable bar itself (RETRO-20260916-0621):**
RI Governor GOP primary (Sep 8, 2026), category-bar declined on both
legs off the same Aug 3-11 poll (Pelino 37 / Guckian 17 / undecided 44,
n=857): `1d37368ed8f2` Pelino Yes est 0.80 vs mkt 0.905 **LOST**;
`09bc7a9861e8`/`ee25da18db9d` Guckian Yes est 0.09 vs mkt 0.098 **WON**.
The market itself was pricing the eventual loser at 0.905 the night
before the vote — same shape as the WI Hong/Crowley miss that founded
this rule (large undecided share, market wrong too, not just the
poll-derived estimate), at zero bankroll cost because the bar kept both
legs forecast-only. No rule change; the bar keeps calling this correctly.

**Price-inside-the-model-range rule (RETRO-20260921-0633, numeric-polling
elections and any other self-built model):** when my model prints a RANGE
across defensible input choices (poll weighting, recency window, error sd)
and the market price lies inside that range, the claimed edge is an input
choice, not a disagreement: record `no-edge` and do not bet. A bet needs the
price outside the WHOLE range by at least `min_edge`, and the forecast note
must quote the range. Evidence: Berlin Linke-most No `7ec71e307f12` LOST
−$5 (MC 0.55 recency-weighted to 0.665 newest-poll-only, price 0.665, own
0.60 picked mid-range, "edge" 0.05); all six Berlin Linke/CDU reads sat on
the CDU side of a deep 0.01-spread book and all six lost to the mid
(dBrier +0.005 to +0.114, one draw). Counter-instance where the test passes:
MV AfD `506bc4c8087e` (sd sweep 0.80-0.96 vs ask 0.77, won). Corollary
(label consistency): a market declined as `unvalidated-method` stays
declined on that method until a settled row validates it; a smaller edge
days later is not new evidence (Sep 14 decline at edge 0.06, Sep 18 bet at
0.05, same Gaussian). Keep counting, not yet a rule: in both Sep 20 states
my precedent adjustment (Berlin-2023 CDU bonus, Brandenburg-2024 SPD
consolidation) shaded AWAY from the poll leader and the poll leader won
(n=2 elections, one night).

## Outside-view veto: settled counterfactual ledger (DEEP-2026-08-15)

Per-row fill arithmetic over ALL settled `outside-view-veto` forecast rows
(flat 1u on the model's side at the recorded book; the discipline the
RETRO-20260813-1707 correction demanded). This table supersedes every
narrative "N-for-N" veto claim; future veto-record statements cite it and
extend it at each settlement.

**Append discipline (DEEP-2026-09-02, bloat control):** this file crossed
3,300 lines and the dated multi-paragraph batch narratives in this section
are the fastest-growing block (+248 playbook lines in the 09-01→09-02
window alone; every line is re-read by every hourly cycle). From now on a
settled veto batch appends ONLY: its table rows, the one-line re-summed
totals + side split with the arithmetic check, and at most 2–3 sentences
of ruling. The full narrative (family history, method grading, lessons)
lives in that settlement's retro, referenced by filename — the retro is
already mandatory same-commit, so nothing is lost. Existing blocks stay
as-is for now; if growth continues the next deep retro should compact the
CLOSED-family narratives (Mythos, box-office Aug31, touch-family, AAA gas)
down to their tables + retro pointers.

the pending touch-family gate rather than the numeric boundary, but the

the sub-boundary WI Hong No rows — resolved No, **+0.22u** win. That row
also grades the title-window≠resolution-window discipline note

existing Yes/No asymmetry flagged since 2026-08-26/27 for a future deep

on it).

**2026-09-01 update (RETRO-20260901-1350; 8 rows, AAA gas-price
touch-anytime set, all settled this tick).** All 8 legs (event 769509,
first recorded 2026-08-17 as `outside-view-veto`, self-model + uniform
large disagreement, 0 bets) resolved No — the national-average price
never touched any of the 8 thresholds. Model favored No on every leg
(est 0.01-0.035 vs live book 0.05-0.19); a clean directional sweep,
though highly correlated (one price path drove all 8 legs, not 8
independent draws) and still resting on the unvalidated 4-weekly-point
sigma the original note flagged. Fill reference = best_bid_at_record (ask
where no bid was posted); CF profit = 1/(1−ref) − 1 on the No side.

vetoed-would-have-won, RETRO-20260901-0025) where the self-model's
*direction* beat the market despite an unvalidated sigma — flagged for
the next deep retro's cross-family self-model review, not a policy
change at this n (correlated legs, still no sourced daily-price series).
No ranking/veto-boundary edit; AAA gas-price touch-anytime stays

**2026-09-01 update (LIGHT tick 22:xxZ; 5 rows, the Mythos-class
"by-date" nested-deadline family, all settled this tick after the
official Anthropic announcement of Claude Mythos 5.1 / Fable 5.1
propagated on-chain).** Same underlying fact as the 4-row Mythos-No
batch already in this table (RETRO-20260901-0639, all 4 WON), but these
are the LATER snapshots — checked Aug29 through the actual release day —
and this time the model favored No on every leg and **all 5 LOST**: the
release the rumor pointed at actually happened Sep1, hours after the
last WebSearch check on several of these legs came back "no confirmed
announcement." Not 5 independent confirmations — one correlated signal
(same underlying release, five deadline windows) — but a clean reversal
of the earlier batch's direction as the true event got closer.

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mythos by-Sep9 No (1f20cadb2b53) | 0.85 / 0.27 | No | +0.580 | Yes | −1.00 |

(720781176db9 and 237402dd3f1e are sequential re-checks of the SAME
by-Sep1 market, same convention as the earlier Mythos No sequence —
both count as separate row-time snapshots, per the existing table
practice.) **Totals now 65 realizable trades, 31W/34L, net −15.62u.**
Side split re-summed row-by-row over the full table: **Yes-side
unchanged 3W/17L, −12.75u**; **No-side 28W/17L, −2.87u** (adds this
batch's 0W/5L, −5.00u — the No side's first net-negative turn since the
AAA gas batch pushed it positive). Check: −12.75 + −2.87 = −15.62 ✓.
Full Mythos-rumor-family lifetime tally (9 rows, both batches): 4W/5L,
net +3.33−5.00 = **−1.67u** — betting real money against this rumor
would have lost money over the family's full life, reinforcing (not
contradicting) the fact-finality gate: zero capital was ever actually
risked on any of these 9 rows, exactly because "unconfirmed rumor" stays
vetoed regardless of the model's confidence, and the model's confidence
here would have been wrong more often than right by the end. No
veto-boundary change — this is the gate working as designed, not a
reason to loosen it. Concrete estimation lesson, encoded below in
§Estimation method (same-day-deadline WebSearch-timing sub-bullet): a
single WebSearch check earlier in the day on a "by end-of-date-X"
deadline market, with an active rumor of an imminent event, is weak
evidence for No if the deadline hasn't fully elapsed — three of these
five legs were checked hours before the actual announcement landed
later the SAME day, and "no confirmation as of this morning's search"
was read as informative when it was mostly a search-timing artifact.
Re-check same-day deadlines close to the actual cutoff before
finalizing a rumor-based No, don't rely on one AM check.

**2026-09-02 update (00:15Z FULL cycle: box-office Aug31 gross-threshold
pair CLOSED, pre-registered 2026-08-22, watch item in schedule.json).**
The Odyssey/Spider-Man BND domestic-gross family settled: Odyssey missed
$570M (d48834ed8f41), Spider-Man BND missed $900M but landed in
[800M,900M) — the sibling bracket for that exact range (e9f9221a3afb)
WON as a forecast. Four `outside-view-veto` rows from this family enter
the counterfactual ledger:

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Odyssey ≥570m (d48834ed8f41) | 0.08 / 0.14 | No | +0.057 | No | **+0.16** |
| Spider-Man ≥900m (1f552d2c510f, Aug22 check) | 0.25 / 0.336 | No | +0.085 | No | **+0.50** |
| Spider-Man ≥900m (1e889dd4dd33, Aug25 update) | 0.15 / 0.092 | Yes | +0.058 | No | −1.00 |
| Spider-Man <900m (9f40def4f61c) | 0.85 / 0.915 | No | +0.060 | Yes | −1.00 |

(e9f9221a3afb, the 800-900m bracket itself, was a genuine market-agrees
no-edge read — 0.90 vs ask 0.86 — not a veto row, so it doesn't enter
this table.) Net this batch: **−1.34u** (2W/2L). **Totals now 69
realizable trades, 33W/36L, net −16.96u.** Side split re-summed: **Yes-side
3W/18L, −13.75u** (adds this batch's 0W/1L, −1.00u); **No-side 30W/18L,
−3.21u** (adds this batch's 2W/1L, +0.66u−1.00u=−0.34u). Check: −13.75 +
−3.21 = −16.96 ✓.

Grading the two things schedule.json's watch item asked for: (1) **the
veto boundary** — this batch's ledger P&L is net negative (−1.34u), so
the veto continues to look correct on net even though two of the four
counterfactual sides won; no change to the standing box-office
self-model veto. (2) **the trend-extrapolation method itself** — on
*directional* accuracy it was clean: all four legs' Aug22-25 point
projections (Odyssey ~544M, Spider-Man ~875-897M) correctly bracketed
where the film actually landed (Odyssey short of 570M, Spider-Man inside
[800M,900M)). But the two Aug25-update legs (1e889dd4dd33, 9f40def4f61c)
lost as counterfactual trades anyway, because by Aug25 the market itself
had already converged to 91-92%/90-92% confidence in the correct
bracket — the model's residual disagreement with an already-converged
market was noise, not edge, even though the model's own point estimate
was directionally fine. Lesson for this family: a trend-extrapolation
edge claim late in the window, against a market that has already priced
in the same trend data, deserves more skepticism than the same claim
made earlier — the method's forecasting skill and its counterfactual
tradeability are not the same thing once the market catches up. No
playbook rule change; this reinforces (not contradicts) routing box-office
self-models through the veto regardless of claimed edge. Item closed, no
further grading duty.

**2026-09-02 update (RETRO-20260902-0212, LIGHT tick; 2 rows, first
settled instances of the transfer-window narrative/negotiation-speculation
sub-shape — soccer-transfer / news-transfer category, no mechanical

stay-at-Chelsea (`dc81cc744a86`, est P(stay)=0.60 vs ask 0.312, Yes side)

batch's Man City loss). Check: −14.75 + −4.21 = −18.96 ✓. n=2, 0W/2L —
consistent with (not yet a distinct named instance of) the standing
outside-view-veto discipline; too small to write a dedicated rule. Worth
noting: the 4 later join-Man-City snapshots that went market-agrees
instead of chasing the narrative (once the book itself converged past
~0.85 with real depth) all landed on the winning side — downgrading from
a confident narrative read to market-agrees as the book firms is what
kept most of this family off the losing side of the ledger.

**2026-09-02 update (RETRO-20260902-1814, FULL cycle; 4 rows, Gemini
Flash 3.8+ leak/rumor family fully settled).** All four sequential
outside-view-veto snapshots on "next Gemini Flash release by/on Sep2"
settled: the model WAS released, so every No-side veto lost as a
counterfactual trade. Same rumor-convergence shape as the Mythos family
(DEEP-2026-09-01, 22:xxZ) — unofficial leaks (codename "skimaki"/Jetski)
converged on the correct date well before official confirmation, and the
market priced that correctly while the fact-finality gate correctly
declined to bet against it:

Check: −14.75 + −8.21 = −22.96 ✓. Est climbed 0.13→0.50→0.58→0.58 as
corroborating leaks piled up (correctly applying the Mythos-episode
same-day-deadline lesson — later checks, not one AM read), but even the
final 0.58 stayed well below the market's 0.775-0.79, and the market was
right. Reinforces, does not contradict, the standing gate: zero capital
was ever at risk on any of these four rows, exactly because "unconfirmed
leak, however convergent" stays vetoed regardless of claimed edge. The
two same-cycle crypto-touch settlements (BTC $77.5k, ETH $2400, both WON)
carried ~0 realizable edge at record time (est essentially at the book)

yet added to this table (0.028, under min_edge 0.04) — the veto's own
timeline-rumor read was correct, but n=1 at this edge size is not
evidence for lowering any floor.

class now 2W/3L, −1.74u. Ruling: the two losses were recorded at 10:22 and
12:18 local time on the resolution day with the next-day sd=1.2C applied
to a half-observed day (the 33C bucket was the point forecast's own mean;
the market had it at 0.845, the model 0.323). **Same-day weather rows must
condition on the observed partial-day max (open-meteo hourly, `past_days=1`,
or `current`) with sd 0.6C after local noon; if that fetch fails, no
forecast at all.** Next-day rows keep sd=1.2C. Category stays no-bet.

Check: −15.75 + −7.96 = −23.71 ✓. Weather-Gaussian class now 3W/4L,
−2.18u; next-day sub-class 2W/2L. Ruling: recorded 05:22 local (pre-dawn),
so functionally next-day and untouched by the same-day rule above. The
market put 0.94 on two adjacent buckets (implied sd ≈0.55C vs the model's
1.2C) and was right; at about six settled next-day rows, test the
open-meteo ensemble spread per city against the fixed sd. No change now.

**2026-09-04 update (FULL cycle 04:13Z, retro RETRO-20260904-0413; 2 rows,
GTA VI Extended Look <20M-views week-1 market, two of its four sequential
snapshots):**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |

| GTA VI <20M wk1 (b5c5c134d7cb) | 0.55 / 0.60 | No | +0.030 | No | **+1.38** |
| GTA VI <20M wk1 (e398cebab2e6) | 0.30 / 0.82 | No | +0.510 | No | **+4.26** |

Net this batch: **+5.64u** (2W/0L). **Totals now 85 realizable trades,
39W/46L, net −18.07u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
unchanged 3W/20L, −15.75u**; **No-side 36W/26L, −2.32u** (adds this
batch's 2W/0L, +5.64u). Check: −15.75 + −2.32 = −18.07 ✓. Both wins are
late, well-anchored trend-extrapolation reads on a market with an actual
climbing view count (own family narrative in the retro), the mirror image
of the two other sequential snapshots on this same market that guessed
without a dated figure and both lost as forecasts — the veto still
correctly avoided capital risk on a narrative/trend-extrapolation class
that is net-negative lifetime even after these two wins.

**Operator-machine 03:40Z cycle (RETRO-20260904-0340), merged by the operator 2026-09-04 after the two runners diverged:** its e398cebab2e6 row is the same row as in the 04:13Z table above and is counted once in the totals. It pre-registered sub-class
`countable-metric` (any veto row whose note cites a dated primary count on
a live countable metric: views, downloads, followers, on-chain counts):
now 1W/0L, +4.26u; grade for a carve-out at n≥3 settled rows, veto
unchanged until then. Rows without a dated count stay narrative class.

**Cumulative-count anchor rule (DEEP-2026-09-04, from the four settled
snapshots above plus b3fbd3c3eef7/944d8e5fc4d0):** a forecast on a
cumulative-count market (views, downloads, signatures, cumulative sales)
requires a DATED count plus an observed per-day pace, exactly as same-day
weather rows require the observed partial-day max. The settled split is
stark: the two snapshots with no dated figure scored brier 0.3025
(b5c5c134d7cb, "coin-flip with a fig-leaf of numbers") and 0.7225
(b3fbd3c3eef7, est 0.85 on <20M while the count was climbing through
17M — it followed the market's re-pricing and called it confirmation);
the one snapshot with a dated anchor (~17M at day 5-6, ~3.4M/day) scored
0.09 (e398cebab2e6). If no dated count is findable, record NO forecast
(skip reason `no-anchor`) rather than a number — an unanchored estimate
here contaminates calibration stats the same way a half-observed day did
in weather. Market-agrees re-pricing is NOT an anchor: on a trending
count the market re-pricing toward your prior is what being late looks
like.

**Pace must be observed, not inferred (RETRO-20260926-2015, MrBeast
v9QtM6qnG50 wk1).** The 16:19Z Sep25 60-70M read (92a9d80fc3c3, 0.59 vs
0.3835) had a count (RYD 65.6M) but INFERRED the pace (~1.6M/day from a
day-2 summary); the first two dated reads 4h apart then showed 0.30M/h
(~7M/day) and the market's 70-80M lean won. The pace in "dated count plus
observed pace" means two dated reads of the same source at least ~3h
apart; with one read, the row is still `no-anchor`/veto territory. Also
measured: RYD (returnyoutubedislikeapi) lagged the YouTube watch page by
only ~19k views at 20:20Z Sep25, so a RYD read stamped with its fetch time
counts as a dated read when YouTube 429s.

**2026-09-04 update (LIGHT tick 06:29Z, settled by resolve.py; 4 rows,
two OpenAI Astra release-timeline markets, two sequential snapshots
each):**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Net this batch: **+33.46u** (4W/0L). **Totals now 89 realizable trades,
43W/46L, net +15.39u** — the ledger's first-ever positive cumulative
total. Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side unchanged 3W/20L,
−15.75u**; **No-side 40W/26L, +31.14u** (adds this batch's 4W/0L,
+33.46u). Check: −15.75 + 31.14 = 15.39 ✓. Both markets resolved No
(Astra did not clear each market's specific by/on-Sep3 public-access
bar in time) against books priced 83–94c Yes; the fact-finality gate
(DEEP-2026-08-30) correctly avoided capital on all four snapshots but
this is the single largest realizable-edge miss in the table by a wide
margin, driven almost entirely by a8d12b4831b4's 6c No ask on a
near-certain-looking Yes book. n=2 distinct markets (4 snapshots) is
not grounds to loosen the gate — the same family's earlier by-Sep2 leg
(2daa083970d8, not in this table, already lost as a straight forecast)
and the wider Yes-side 3W/20L record argue the opposite direction on
timeline-rumor markets generally; full grading in
RETRO-20260904-0629.

**Touch-family gate CLOSED (DEEP-2026-09-01; pre-registered 2026-08-28
21:35Z, all 3 legs settled):** leg 3 BTC dip-$75k (753366c2ea8e,
measured-vol, est 0.38 vs mid 0.315) LOST — final record ETH dip-2400
measured-vol WON (brier 0.040 vs mkt 0.106), BTC-82k guessed-vol LOST
(0.203 vs 0.068), BTC dip-75k measured-vol LOST (0.144 vs 0.099).
Aggregate brier: own 0.129 vs market 0.091 — the market won the family.
All three own reads sat above market and 2 of 3 resolved No, but the leg
with the largest above-market gap won, so the vol-overstatement signature
is suggestive, not confirmed. **Ruling:** the crypto touch/reflection
family stays `unvalidated-method` forecast-only — no bets. Guessed-vol
inputs are RETIRED from this family: any future touch forecast must use
measured realized vol or market-implied vol from an adjacent ladder rung
(guessed-vol is 0W/1L live, and the superseded guessed-vol ETH row
d2431685b1a3 won with a brier 2.3× worse than its measured-vol
replacement — it has never outperformed the market or its measured
sibling). Re-grade the family at n≥6 settled measured-vol rows (currently
1W/1L: edd6af85d6a6 W, 753366c2ea8e L).

**2026-09-21 12:24Z update (RETRO-20260921-1224; re-grade counter pinned,
family shade dropped):** RETRO-20260921-1025 counted the family by label
(every crypto-touch `unvalidated-method` row) and reached "n=5, re-grade at
the next settlement". Three of those rows (`07a247cac126` guessed sigma,
`a28637cb4026` swept sigma, `3acf7b55a29f` no model) are outside the
pre-registration above. The counter, from now on:

- A row counts only if its note quotes a measured realized vol or a
  market-implied vol with a named, dated source. Labels do not count rows.
- Sibling rungs of one asset and one window, recorded from the same vol
  input, count as ONE decision (score them all, count them once).
- A row recorded with the barrier within 0.5% of spot is listed but carries
  no weight.

Tally at this commit: 5 settled measured rows, 4W/1L, own Brier sum 0.4786
vs market 0.6005 (own ahead by 0.1219): `edd6af85d6a6` W, `753366c2ea8e` L,
`fde4324641b4` W (0.03% gap, no weight), `bad4649e1e7a` + `423dd881047b` W
(one decision, BTC reach Sep). That is 4 decisions, 3 informative. Open
measured rows, all settling by 2026-10-01 04:00Z: `854536ded8be`,
`942876f92dd8`, `10f71ccecca3`, `cbc8303dc2a8`. The re-grade runs in the
retro of the tick that settles the 6th measured row, and splits reach rows
from dip rows (a month of rising prices flatters every reach read).

Shade: a touch row records the `touch.py` output at the measured vol. The
"family's above-market record" shade toward the 0.75x-vol reading is
dropped: on measured rows the above-market reads went 4 for 5, the shade
cost 0.070 (`423dd881047b`) and 0.015 (`bad4649e1e7a`) Brier, and a shaded
row no longer tests the method the re-grade is about. A shade needs a
row-specific reason in the note. Forecast-only ruling unchanged: no bets.

**2026-10-02 22:15Z (RETRO-20261002-2215): tally.** GOOGL HIGH $360
`142619e6dbae` (0.28 vs mid 0.345) and AAPL HIGH $340 `d7e66de49d0c` (0.22 vs
0.255) both settled no-touch and beat the mid (-0.041, -0.017).
equity-touch is now n=8, dBrier +0.0173: still forecast-only. The GOOGL row
blended in the 0.75x-vol reading and gave a row-specific reason (the
premarket print was stale). It helped this once (n=1), so the
no-default-shade rule stands. Stale-mid rule (any single-stock row): when
the live CLOB book contradicts gamma's bestBid/ask mid by 0.10 or more, the
note records the live mid explicitly ("live mid X"). Evidence: the GOOGL
$340-345 close band `8de7ff599222` was graded against a stale 0.725 while
the live book was 0.36/0.74.

**2026-09-25 22:13Z (RETRO-20260925-2213): an inferred open is not a
measured input.** Single-stock touch rows record `touch.py` from the last
close, or from an actually quoted premarket print. An open inferred from
index futures x beta goes in the note as "shade view: X", never into
est_prob. Evidence: PLTR HIGH $195 `a468e40297ae` recorded 0.74 (between
0.678 from the close and 0.864 from an NQ-beta open), no touch, dBrier
+0.293 vs mid 0.505; the overlay alone cost 0.088. A shade grounded in a
measured print (SPY LOW $760 `23a99c8fe4e8`, ES overnight + RTH-only
window, 0.118 -> 0.08) helped by 0.0075. equity-touch now n=2, dBrier
+0.163: forecast-only, no bets.

**2026-09-21 20:44Z update (RETRO-20260921-2044; far-barrier split added):**
`8d1eb46b7c32` (ETH reach $2,800, own 0.25 vs mid 0.155) settled WON, dBrier
-0.1515. Listed, NOT counted: its note sweeps sigma 50-90%, no measured
input. Tally unchanged (5 rows, 4 decisions, 3 informative). Hindsight
`touch.py` on the record-date inputs at measured Binance vol (30d 0.454,
14d 0.491) gives 0.11-0.14, UNDER the 0.155 mid, on a 15% barrier that fell
to one +7% day: the driftless tool has no jump term and the book prices far
barriers above it (same gap on open `cbc8303dc2a8`). n=1, no ruling change.
The re-grade therefore splits rows twice: reach vs dip, AND barrier gap at
record time under 10% vs 10% or more. Open measured rows now:
`854536ded8be`, `942876f92dd8`, `10f71ccecca3`, `cbc8303dc2a8`,
`86415cf1e27f`. `395a07f3f815` (ETH $3,200, guessed vol) is outside the
counter.

**2026-09-23 08:10Z (RETRO-20260923-0810): WTI September ladder listed.**
The five-rung WTI ladder (`18672a24a234`, `98134efdddcf`, `0ad60d107c54`,
`52fac91e76d7`, `41c92e76901c`) quotes a market-implied vol with a named,
dated source (OVX 57.49, FRED OVXCLS Sep 16), so it qualifies; one asset,
one window, one vol input makes it ONE open decision, counted when its
last rung settles (~Oct 1). Settled so far: LOW95 W and LOW90 W, both
above market, dBrier sum -0.0660. Tally of settled decisions unchanged.

**2026-09-23 15:0xZ RE-GRADE (RETRO-20260923-1500; 6th and 7th measured
rows settled):** `820604783edf` (ETH dip $2,700, own 0.90 vs mid 0.94,
gap 0.82%) and `c07c05bc24af` (BTC dip $85k, own 0.93 vs mid 0.9415, gap
0.52%) both WON; both unshaded, measured Binance 30d vol, two assets so
two decisions. Tally: 7 rows, 6 decisions, 5 informative (`fde4324641b4`
carries no weight). Row Brier own 0.4935 vs market 0.6074 (own ahead
0.114). Splits:
- Dip (4 decisions): own 0.1993 vs mkt 0.2118, own ahead 0.0125, but the
  market was closer on 3 of 4; `edd6af85d6a6` alone carries the lead.
- Reach (1 decision, the BTC Sep 82.5k/85k pair, both shaded): own 0.2941
  vs mkt 0.3956. One correlated decision in a rising month.
- Far barrier (gap 10% or more): no counted rows. Untested.
- Direction: own above market 3 times (2W/1L), below market 2 times
  (both resolved Yes, market closer both times).
Decision-weighted (sibling rows averaged): own 0.3464 vs mkt 0.4096, but
only 2 of 5 informative decisions beat the market.
**Ruling:** stays `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only, no bets. The
aggregate lead rests on two decisions (`edd6af85d6a6` and the reach
pair); the other three went to the market, and the far-barrier and
multi-decision reach cells are empty. Pre-registered NOW, so the next
grade cannot be post hoc: promote to a bettable edge class only if, at
10 or more informative decisions, (a) decision-weighted Brier beats the
market in BOTH the reach and the dip split with at least 3 decisions
each, and (b) own beats the market on at least 60% of decisions. Until
then keep recording every scan-surfaced qualifying row, unshaded, and
keep splitting near/far barrier.

**2026-09-24 DEEP re-grade (8th and 9th measured rows; settled by the
deep retro's own resolve run at ~04:3xZ, so no hourly retro graded
them).** `6c1236ca11fe` (BTC dip $83k on Sep 23, own 0.24 vs mid
0.2055) and `8a4bb9cfde9c` (ETH dip $2,600 on Sep 23, own 0.09 vs mid
0.085) both LOST (no dip); both unshaded, measured Binance 30d vol, two
assets so two decisions, both near-barrier dips (gap ~3%). Market closer
on both (row dBrier +0.0154 / +0.0009). Tally: 9 rows, 7 informative
decisions; own beats the market on **2 of 7**. Dip split: 6 decisions,
own closer on 1. Direction pattern: own ABOVE market on all 4 intraday
dip reads since 09-17 and the market was closer on 3 of them — the
unshaded 30d-realized-vol reflection read slightly overstates same-day
touch odds (n=4, pattern only, not a rule).
**Bar arithmetic, stated so nobody grades it hopefully later:** at 10
informative decisions the best possible own-closer count is 5/10 = 50%,
below the 60% bar in (b). The 10-decision promotion is now unreachable;
it would take 13 straight own-closer decisions to reach 60% at any n.
**Ruling:** stays `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only, indefinitely. Keep
recording scan-surfaced rows (cheap, and the WTI ladder decision is
still open ~Oct 1), but do NOT spend research priority on generating new
touch rows — priority 1 "feed the measured-row counter" (15:00Z
2026-09-23 funnel note) is retired. The family matches the market; it
does not beat it.

**2026-09-25 12:0xZ tally (RETRO-20260925-1207; 10th and 11th measured
rows).** `4cf126698087` (SOL reach $120 Sep, own 0.83 vs mid 0.808, gap
2.2%, CoinGecko 31d vol) and `e9398115e4ad` (BTC reach $85k from Sep 23,
own 0.91 vs mid 0.83, gap 0.60%, Binance 30d vol) both WON, both
unshaded, own closer on both (dB -0.0080 / -0.0208). Two assets, and the
BTC market has its own window (created Sep 23), so two decisions. Tally:
11 rows, 9 informative decisions, own closer on 4 of 9. Reach split: 3
decisions, own closer on all 3; dip split: 6 decisions, own closer on 1.
All three reach wins came in a rising month and all near-barrier, so the
split is the pattern to watch, not a licence. Bar arithmetic corrected:
the "13 straight" figure above was computed at 2 of 7. At 4 of 9, four
more own-closer decisions in a row reach 8/13 = 62%, so criterion (b) is
reachable again; criterion (a) still needs the dip split to beat the
market on decision-weighted Brier. Ruling unchanged: forecast-only
"indefinitely" stands until a deep retro re-grades against the full
pre-registered bar, and a reach-only slice never re-opens it.

**2026-10-01 04:45Z tally (RETRO-20261001-0445; September month-end
batch plus three ungraded Sep 21-27 weekly rows).** 15 new decisions,
own closer on 8. Running: **12 of 24 (50%)**; reach 7 of 12, dip 4 of 11,
far barrier 5 of 5 (first counted far rows). Counting choices, fixed
for later grades: one asset + one record time + one vol input is one
decision even when the rungs point opposite ways (ETH reach $3,200 + dip
$2,500 is one far decision, left out of the reach/dip split); a mid
from a placeholder book (bid 0.01, spread 0.14 or more: DOGE $0.15 and
$0.20, XRP $2.80) carries no weight. Every row resolved No in a
range-bound month-end, so the split is one draw: own above the mid lost
7 of 7 (all near barriers, 3-9 day windows, 30d vol 0.41-0.69 while the
quoted 6d realized was ~0.2), own below the mid won 8 of 8. Bar (b) now
needs 6 straight own-closer decisions. Ruling unchanged: forecast-only.

**2026-10-02 05:03Z tally (RETRO-20261002-0503; 2 more measured
decisions).** `afc6b3e66078` (BTC dip $83k Oct 1, own 0.47 vs mid 0.64,
gap -1.05%, window 18.2h) LOST and `bcf51c6612b2` (BTC reach $86k Sep
28-Oct 4, own 0.40 vs mid 0.355, gap +2.53%, window 3.76d) WON; both
near-barrier, both recorded at the 7-day regime-lag read, both own closer
(dip brier 0.2209 vs mkt 0.4096; reach brier 0.36 vs mkt 0.416). Running:
**14 of 26 (53.8%)**; reach 8/13 (61.5%), dip 5/12 (41.7%), far barrier
unchanged 5/5. Criterion (b) (60% bar) still not met. Criterion (a) still
not met — dip split still below 50% own-closer. Ruling unchanged:
forecast-only.
**Pre-registered test (not a rule):** every near-barrier (gap under 10%)
touch row with a window of 10 days or less also quotes `touch.py` at
the 7-day realized vol in its note; est_prob stays at the 30-day read
unless a row-specific reason is written. The next re-grade scores the
30d read against the 7d read on those rows. Hypothesis: the 30-day
window lags a quieter regime, so above-mid near reads overstate touch
odds (7 of 7 here, 3 of 4 in DEEP-2026-09-24, Silver and Gold month-end
LOW rows in RETRO-20260930-2316 and RETRO-20261001-0020).

**2026-10-01 (RETRO-20261001-0625): first far-barrier row settled.**
`b9687ea473f8` (ETH reach $3k Sep, gap 11.9%, touch.py measured vol 0.467,
own 0.09 vs mid 0.115) LOST (no touch); own closer, dBrier -0.0051. Far
split: 1 decision, own closer on 1. On the 2026-09-25 count (4 of 9)
this makes 5 of 10, but later touch rows (e.g. BTC dip 82.5K
`c8853475ea55`, DEEP-2026-10-01) were not folded into that count, so the
next deep retro re-counts from the ledger. Ruling unchanged.

**2026-09-27 18:1xZ (RETRO-20260927-1815): scheduled-close crypto
strikes/brackets are a SEPARATE family from touch, and my realized-vol
read has lost all three.** `ed46e73085f3` (BTC $76-78k Sep 12, own 0.53 vs
mid 0.945), `4a1df602fb13` (ETH $2.5-2.6k Sep 12, own 0.55 vs 0.705) and
`a10c93456a38` (BTC above $84k Sep 27, own 0.60 vs 0.745) all settled
Yes; the market was closer on 3 of 3 (row dBrier +0.35 / +0.11 / +0.10).
Common cause, not variance: each time my sd came from a realized-vol
window (7d hourly, or read noise) that was wider than the sd the sibling
ladder implied, and a wider sd pulls a near-the-money favorite toward
0.5. On `a10c93456a38` the note already had the answer: siblings implied
sd ~0.9% (vs my 1.63%), and the 24h vol gave 0.76. **Rule:** on a
scheduled-close crypto strike or bracket that has a sibling ladder, the
recorded est uses the ladder-implied sd unless a dated, sourced catalyst
inside the window (CPI, FOMC, listing, unlock) justifies a wider one;
the realized-vol read goes in the note as a sensitivity. Forecast-only
stands (n=3, and matching the ladder cannot beat it). Re-grade at n=8.

Excluded per the sub-boundary taxonomy (DEEP-2026-08-15): Zambia
(fa185b55a5c3, edge 0.06) and Musk wk 200-219 (7808b6f5a4ef, edge 0.045)
both settled this tick too, but both carry claimed edges ≤0.10 under a
blanket category bar (elections; social-media-postcount respectively) —
the bar, not the numeric veto, is the operative decline reason, so they
grade their category narratives (§Extension to general elections; the
bootstrap fork below), not this ledger. Same treatment already applied to
140-159 (70331099597c) and the still-open 160-179 (c24926a5c9d7). Same
exclusion again 2026-08-21: this week's Musk wk 260-279 (42dc4279d3b9,
edge 0.05, category-bar) settled LOST but is off-ledger for the same
reason — the blanket bar, not the veto, is what declined it. Excluded
again 2026-08-26 (RETRO-20260826-0528): WI Hong 10-15% (03901079bd63) —
est (0.090) sits on the market mid (0.089), and the fill-price check shows
negative edge both sides (Yes 0.090−0.107=−0.017; No 0.910−0.929=−0.019),
so there is no realizable disagreement at all, not merely one under the
0.10 bar — same non-trade treatment as the PPI 5.4%/≥6.0% rows.

**2026-08-26 update (05:28Z settlement): six-row Wisconsin Hong
margin-of-victory bracket batch settled, all No (Hong lost the primary
outright).** 3W (No side, small longshot-payout profits: +0.08+0.09+0.25 =
+0.42u) / 3L (Yes side, all −1.00u) — a clean, uncorrelated confirmation of
the existing pattern: every Yes-side disagreement in this batch lost,
every No-side disagreement won. **Totals now 30 realizable trades, 11W/19L,
net −12.00u**; side split re-summed row-by-row over the full table:
**Yes-side 1W/12L, −10.50u** (three new losses, no new wins — extends the
Yes-side lifetime record to 1-for-13); **No-side 10W/7L, −1.50u** (three
new wins — the No-side hit rate is now a genuine majority, 59%, even
though the side stays net-negative in dollars because longshot-No fills
pay little on a win and the earlier No-side losses were larger stakes at
worse prices). Check: −10.50 + −1.50 = −12.00 ✓. No playbook rule change
from this row alone (see RETRO-20260826-0528) — the widened Yes-side split
is flagged for the next deep retro's Yes/No-side asymmetry discussion, not
acted on here.

**2026-08-26 update (17:12Z settlement): Kuala Lumpur 30C weather row
added, first settled row from the new weather category (exploration
budget, DEEP-2026-08-25 22:xxZ); Beijing 26C sibling settled the same tick
but is EXCLUDED from this table — est 0.23 vs ask 0.23/bid 0.21 leaves no
realizable edge either side (Yes: 0.23−0.23=0.00; No: 0.21−0.23=−0.02),
same non-trade treatment as WI Hong 10-15%.** KL: est 0.26 (Yes) vs ask
0.079, edge +0.181, actual high was NOT 30C → Yes lost, −1.00u. The
directional read matters more than the single row: the market priced the
30C bucket at just 0.073 against my model's 0.26-0.28 (implied warmer
actual than my open-meteo N(30.65,1.2) mean), and the market was right —
supports hypothesis (a) from the exploration-budget note (my model reads
systematically cool / too-coarse), not hypothesis (b) (thin-market
mispricing). Beijing, the one city where my model and the market had
already agreed almost exactly (0.228 vs 0.22), losing on its minority
bucket is uninformative either way. Totals at that point: 31 realizable
trades, 11W/20L, net −13.00u; Yes-side 1W/13L −11.50u; No-side 10W/7L
−1.50u. New generation class: weather Gaussian (self-modeled sd,
unvalidated) 0W/1L −1.00u.

**2026-08-26 update (23:19Z settlement): Amsterdam 25C weather row added —
the other open row from this batch (the Spider-Man BND sibling settles
separately, not part of the weather-Gaussian class).** No side, est 0.87 vs
ask 0.56 (edge +0.31), actual result No (25C did NOT occur) → **won**, CF
P&L +0.79u. This is NOT a same-direction replicate of KL — see the
exploration-budget section above for the correction (Amsterdam's market
mode, 25C, was *below* the model's mean, opposite of KL where the market's
mode was *above* — the two rows disagree, not confirm each other, and no
category verdict follows from this n=2). **Totals now 32 realizable
trades, 12W/20L, net −12.21u**; side split re-summed row-by-row over the
full table: **Yes-side unchanged 1W/13L, −11.50u**; **No-side 11W/7L,
−0.71u** (one new win, +0.79u vs the prior −1.50u). Check: −11.50 + −0.71 =
−12.21 ✓. Weather-Gaussian generation class now 1W/1L, net −0.21u (was
0W/1L, −1.00u).

**2026-08-27 update (DEEP retro): six rows added that the hourly cycles
settled but never entered — Crowley (07:28Z, no retro written), the three
PCE MoM legs (15:21Z retro graded them but skipped the same-commit table
duty), and the BoK pair (04:13Z, logged "at-market/veto-correct" with no
retro when the vetoed read had in fact WON — see reconcile.py check 5,
welded off the back of exactly these three misses).** Row notes:
Crowley is the day's ugliest row — the same single-poll margin model that
generated the Hong brackets put 0.0012 on the man who actually won the
primary at a market 0.032; the No-side fill edge (+0.011) was tiny but
positive, so it enters as a No-side LOSS, a reminder that the No side of a
bad model is still the bad model. PCE MoM 0.2% (+0.014 edge) is effectively
at-market and enters only for convention's consistency (any positive
fill-price edge enters; the WI 15-20% row at +0.023 set the floor).
The BoK pair is ONE underlying decision (complementary books, same
convention as the Musk 2-day and Japan GDP pairs — both rows enter the
table, ONE independent event for any evidence-counting): the analyst-poll
Gaussian-free read (est hike 0.60 vs market 0.32, recorded five days
early) was RIGHT against a confident market, the largest counterfactual
win this ledger has ever recorded (+2.03/+2.13u on the two legs of the one
trade). score.py buckets the pair under `revised_away` (both legs were
superseded to market-agrees rows at 01:25Z after live-CLOB convergence,
hours before on-chain settlement) — the supersede was correct hygiene, but
the counterfactual grades the ORIGINAL record-time book, where the edge
was real and realizable.

**Totals now 38 realizable trades, 16W/22L, net −9.01u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side 3W/14L, −9.75u** (adds BoK hike W +2.03,
PCE 0.2% W +0.72, PCE 0.1% L −1.00); **No-side 13W/8L, +0.74u** (adds BoK
hold W +2.13, PCE 0.3% W +0.32, Crowley L −1.00) — the No side crosses
into positive territory for the first time. Check: −9.75 + 0.74 = −9.01 ✓.

**2026-08-28 update (16:18Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260828-1618): UMich
Consumer Sentiment FINAL settled (final print 51.7, in-bracket for
49.0-51.9).** Two outside-view-veto rows enter this table. UMich <49.0
(a5703b36d60a): model P(Yes)=0.334 vs live ask 0.177, Yes side, fill-price
edge +0.157 (est − ask); actual No → **lost, −1.00u**. UMich 49.0-51.9
(fdfd9e781481): model P(Yes)=0.321 vs live bid 0.38, No side (model
favored No since est sits below the bid), fill-price edge = bid − est =
0.38−0.321 = +0.059; actual Yes (the final print landed in this exact
bracket) → the No side **lost, −1.00u** — the veto correctly avoided this
loss, same shape as the BTC touch-$80k and Japan GDP-veto precedents. The
sibling 55.0-57.9 row (81af56a9a430, wide-spread-veto) is EXCLUDED, not
entered: fill-price check both sides negative (Yes: 0.087−0.14=−0.053; No:
(1−0.087)−(1−0.04)=0.913−0.96=−0.047) — est sits inside the bid/ask
spread, no realizable disagreement either side, same non-trade treatment
as WI Hong 10-15% and the PPI 5.4%/≥6.0% rows. The other four UMich
brackets (6e1ba0c74bf2, a1f502906022, 3e269764b9e6, d5dcc12cdabe) settled
no-edge, not entered per the standing rule. **Totals now 40 realizable
trades, 16W/24L, net −11.01u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row over the
full table: **Yes-side 3W/15L, −10.75u** (adds UMich <49.0 L −1.00);
**No-side 13W/9L, −0.26u** (adds UMich 49.0-51.9 L −1.00, pulling the No
side back to net-negative after one tick at +0.74u). Check: −10.75 + −0.26
= −11.01 ✓.

**Mechanical-econ fork bookkeeping correction (same tick):** the Canada
GDP set (6 rows, ab9d001c5d8a/834d675fc7e8/c6803f47d674/e2bbfd112771/
6b02ffb04b9a market-agrees, fe954ed9f325 excluded as a pre-registered
process error) also settled this tick — **every row was market-agrees;
none crossed the >0.10 outside-view boundary, so the veto never fired and
the print contributes ZERO rows to this counterfactual ledger.** This
contradicts the Aug 17 fork pre-registration's framing of Canada GDP as
automatically "a fourth event" — a settled mechanical-econ print with no
disagreement is not a veto-boundary test at all, it's simply an instance
where the self-model and the market agreed. The two UMich veto rows added
above ARE a new independent mechanical-econ-Gaussian veto event (net
−2.00u, 0/2 on this print) but were never named in the original Aug 17
fork queue (only PCE, BoK, and Canada GDP were). Net effect: the fork
still has exactly 3 named-and-fired events (Japan GDP, PCE, BoK, net
+2.92u, 3/3 dBrier) plus one unplanned fourth (UMich, net −2.00u, 0/1
dBrier this print) — the deep retro due DEEP-2026-08-28/29 must decide
with this corrected picture, not the "Canada GDP adds a fourth event"
assumption baked into the original registration. Not acting on the fork
here per the standing rule (hourly cycles extend the table, do not decide
it).

**The Yes/No asymmetry discussion RETRO-20260826-0528 flagged for this
deep retro, resolved: the asymmetry is a CLASS effect wearing a side
costume.** Before today the split read Yes 1W/13L vs No 11W/7L, which
tempts a side rule ("stop trusting Yes-side disagreements"). Today's two
Yes-side wins (BoK hike, PCE modal bucket) are both mechanical-econ rows
with named external benchmarks, and the historical Yes-side graveyard
(Musk brackets, TI, box-office, WI Hong upside legs) is almost entirely
behavioral self-models — the side was proxying for the generation class.
No side rule is written; the mechanical-vs-behavioral carve-out fork
(below) is the correct instrument, and it already exists with a
pre-registered decision date.

**Mechanical-econ fork running tally (decision due DEEP-2026-08-28/29 as
pre-registered — NOT today; Canada GDP settles Aug 28 and adds a fourth
event):** Japan GDP +0.85u (agent ahead on dBrier), PCE MoM +0.04u net
across the three legs of one print (agent ahead, 0.244 vs 0.264 summed
Brier), BoK +2.03u counting the one trade once (agent ahead, 0.16 vs 0.46
on the hike leg). Three independent settled events, net **+2.92u**, agent
ahead on dBrier in 3/3 — the fork's ≥3-events / net-positive / dBrier-
majority condition is currently MET. Tomorrow's deep retro makes the call
with Canada GDP in hand; firing it a day early on the strongest print in
the sample (BoK, hours old) is exactly the hot-streak overreaction the
pre-registration exists to prevent.

**FORK DECIDED — DEEP-2026-08-28.** Corrected inputs at decision time:
Canada GDP contributed ZERO fork events (no veto fired — every row
market-agrees, per the Aug-28 bookkeeping correction above), and UMich
fired as an unplanned fourth event at −2.00u, agent behind on dBrier
(0/2 rows). Tally: including UMich 4 events net +0.92u dBrier 3/4;
excluding it 3 events +2.92u 3/3. The pre-registered condition (≥3
events, net counterfactual > 0, dBrier majority) is met on BOTH
readings, so the carve-out fires as registered. UMich shapes the gate
rather than blocking the decision: its Gaussian was self-built off the
prelim with a property-2 failure recorded at forecast time (no reachable
variance benchmark) — a self-model in econ clothing, exactly what the
registered candidate shape ("named external survey benchmark") already
excluded. See §Mechanical-econ carve-out below for the enacted rule and
its kill switch.

**2026-09-04 update (16:13Z, FULL cycle, RETRO-20260904-1613): four
Aug23-vintage NFP bracket rows settled (superseded by the Sep4 revision,
graded on their record-time book per standing convention). Actual print:
NFP >= 150k jobs added (a large beat).**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFP add 0-50k (d2c8054e1df6) | 0.1794 / 0.265 | No | +0.071 | No | **+0.33** |
| NFP add 50-100k (7800470f6fab) | 0.218 / 0.315 | No | +0.082 | No | **+0.43** |
| NFP add 100-150k (adc70585857a) | 0.1963 / 0.141 | Yes | +0.055 | No | −1.00 |
| NFP add >=150k (a8a368a644f4) | 0.2266 / 0.145 | Yes | +0.082 | **Yes** | **+6.14** |

Net this batch: **+5.90u** (3W/1L). **Totals now 93 realizable trades,
46W/47L, net +21.29u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
4W/21L, −10.61u** (adds 100-150k L, >=150k W); **No-side 42W/26L,
+31.90u** (adds 0-50k W, 50-100k W). Check: −10.61 + 31.90 = 21.29 ✓.
Ruling: the veto correctly avoided three losing legs, but the >=150k leg
it also declined would have been the single largest win in this table —
the batch nets positive only because that leg happened to hit, which is
outcome luck on a >0.10 disagreement, not method vindication (full
grading in RETRO-20260904-1613, which also covers the two standard-floor
bets on the same print).

**2026-09-04 update (18:13Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260904-1813): one
same-day weather row settled.**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shanghai 31C weather (6aff2db6ddbe) | 0.58 / 0.885 | No | +0.280 | Yes | −1.00 |

**Totals now 94 realizable trades, 46W/48L, net +20.29u.** Side split
re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side unchanged 4W/21L, −10.61u**; **No-side
42W/27L, +30.90u** (adds this loss). Check: −10.61 + 30.90 = 20.29 ✓.
Ruling: model was directionally right (est 0.58 > 0.5) but less
confident than the market's 0.885 given the same partial-day data —
the relative-value No side lost; weather stays no-bet, no gate change
at n=1 (full grading in RETRO-20260904-1813).

**2026-09-04 update (22:11Z, LIGHT tick, RETRO-20260904-2215): five
Astra by-date rows settled, all No-side, all LOST — the family's first
losses ever (previously 5W/0L, by-Sep2 + the by/on-Sep3 batch above).**

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |

unchanged 4W/21L, −10.61u**; **No-side 42W/32L, +25.90u** (adds this
batch's 0W/5L, −5.00u). Check: −10.61 + 25.90 = 15.29 ✓. Ruling: the
first three rows' rationale text cited a market price (0.14/0.315/0.36)
that does NOT match the `best_bid_at_record`/`best_ask_at_record` those
same forecast.py calls actually stamped (0.863/0.685/0.64) — the live
book had already repriced 50+ points same-day and the note never
reflected it; graded against the true recorded book the "modest" declined
edges were actually 0.36–0.78. The other two rows (by-Sep7, by-Sep15)
quoted the price correctly and still lost — clean misses, gate worked as
designed, zero capital risked on any of the five. Full grading and the
new estimation-method fix (quote the exact bid/ask about to be recorded,

hand table is the narrative.** Every future retro that extends this
table also quotes the mechanical ledger's outside-view-veto line
(currently: 106 CF trades, 46W/60L, +$82.17 ≙ +16.4u, brier_delta
+0.0280, held-out +$111.17). The hand table reads +11.29u on 103 trades
because 8 of its rows are trades the protected caps would refuse
(entries ≥0.96 or no bid at record) and some older rows grade edge
against the mid instead of the fill; when the two disagree, the
mechanical ledger wins. Interpretation stays the operator's gnhf-run-4
verdict: the positive CF P&L is one family (Astra snapshots, +34u of
the total; without it the vetoed trades lose), the vetoed beliefs are
worse-calibrated than the market (+0.028), the veto stays.

**2026-09-05 update (14:12Z resolve.py, LIGHT tick; two `wide-spread-veto`
forecasts settled — first wide-spread-veto batch to enter this table
since the Aug14 correction.** Both rows are the same LCK UBF Gen.G vs
Hanwha Life Esports Bo5 (decided 3-1, 4 games total), researched and
vetoed together at 2026-09-02T12:46:38Z. Both legs' directional read was
correct (Over on O/U3.5, Under on O/U4.5), but the mechanical fill
arithmetic uses each row's own recorded `best_ask_at_record` (0.77 and
0.39 respectively), not the book snapshot quoted in the O/U3.5 note
(ask 0.39, implying an apparent +0.26 edge) — the two don't match, a
one-off timing/recording gap between the manual spread-check and
forecast.py's own capture, not yet a pattern (n=1, watch for recurrence
before proposing anything).

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GenG-HLE O/U3.5 (bf608b923988) | 0.65 / 0.40 | Yes | −0.120 | Yes | +0.30 |
| GenG-HLE O/U4.5 (5b76118ad958) | 0.716 / 0.79 | No | −0.106 | Yes | −1.00 |

Net this batch: **−0.70u** (1W/1L). **Totals now 105 realizable trades,
47W/58L, net +10.59u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
5W/22L, −11.31u** (adds this batch's 1W/0L, +0.30u); **No-side 42W/36L,
+21.90u** (adds this batch's 0W/1L, −1.00u). Check: −11.31 + 21.90 =
10.59 ✓. Both legs' realizable edge is negative against the recorded ask
despite the directional read being right on both — the wide-spread
veto's arithmetic justification (crossing the spread erases the apparent
edge) holds even on a batch where the underlying model call was correct.
Ruling: no boundary change at n=2, consistent with the Aug14 correction's
"get the arithmetic right, not a narrative verdict" instruction. Full
grading in RETRO-20260905-1412. Mechanical ledger's wide-spread-veto line
as of this update (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
wide-spread-veto`): 4 settled declined forecasts, 3 fillable CF trades,
1 refused, 2W/1L, pnl −$2.82 (staked $15.00), brier_delta −0.0553,
held-out −$2.83. The outside-view-veto line is unchanged this update:
106 CF trades, 46W/60L, +$82.17 ≙ +16.4u, brier_delta +0.0280, held-out
+$111.17.

**Countable-metric trigger status (DEEP-2026-09-05): fired on the
letter, held shut.** The operator's pre-registered narrowing trigger
(5 settled countable-metric rows, negative brier_delta, positive pnl on
3 of 4 held-out folds) is numerically met (n=5, 4W/1L, +$61.68, dBrier
−0.1367, folds [+6.90, +33.46, +5.00, +21.32, −5.00]) — but all five
rows are snapshots of ONE event (the GTA VI Extended Look view-count

`e441fa8f0f8a`), the same one-family/held-out artifact the operator
flagged on Astra. No carve-out opens on a single event. Operator ask
filed (proposals.md 2026-09-05) to amend the trigger to require ≥3
independent events; quote the countable-metric line each deep-retro

**2026-09-05 update (20:12Z resolve.py, LIGHT tick; 1 `outside-view-veto`
forecast settled.** Guangzhou 35°C same-day exact-temp bracket
(`eb95af0bfe24`, researched 08:22Z): own post-obs est 0.82 vs mid 0.9665
(recorded `market_prob_at_record` 0.927), model's No-side belief (0.18)
well above the market's implied No (~0.033) — outside-view-veto
declined a bet either way (self-modeled in-progress trend, not
fact-final). Settled Yes, so the declined No-side counterfactual trade
lost.

Net this batch: **−1.00u** (0W/1L). **Totals now 106 realizable trades,
47W/59L, net +9.59u.** Side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
unchanged 5W/22L, −11.31u**; **No-side 42W/37L, +20.90u** (adds this
batch's 0W/1L, −1.00u). Check: −11.31 + 20.90 = 9.59 ✓. Ruling: no
boundary change at n=1 — same-day weather family now 1W/3L in this
table's realizable arithmetic (Shanghai/Munich/Miami avoided losses,
Guangzhou did not), consistent with the mechanical ledger's own
same-day-weather subclass (1W/2L, −7.65u) staying net-negative; the
veto's job here is avoiding correlated losses, not winning every row.

**BACKFILL 2026-09-06 16:12Z (found by `strategy/tools/reconcile.py` on the
16:12Z cycle): Munich 25°C same-day exact-temp weather row missing from
this hand table.** Settled 2026-09-06T00:12:47Z (originally researched/vetoed
2026-09-05 08:22Z, `bc29b9874a48`); should have been appended alongside the
Guangzhou row above but was dropped.

| Munich 25°C same-day weather (bc29b9874a48) | 0.26 / 0.23 | Yes | +0.01 | No | −1.00 |

Model (0.26) leaned Yes slightly more than the market mid (0.23); the
realizable counterfactual enters Yes at the 0.25 ask (edge +0.01,
essentially at-market — this was never a real disagreement, just noise
around a near-consensus number). Outcome was No, so the tiny counterfactual
Yes-side edge lost, −1.00u. Per the 2026-09-06 ~00:30Z operator note, this
file's hand totals are narrative only — the mechanical ledger is the
record. Current mechanical outside-view-veto line
(`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason outside-view-veto`, includes

fill), model side Yes on a station-observation-conditioned same-day read
(HKO 04:40 HKT already at 26.7°C, needed ≥0.8°C more cooling in ~2h to
leave the bucket) — vetoed under both self-model-class and wide-spread

won.

same-day weather subclass now 2W/2L in the mechanical ledger's own grouping
(was 1W/2L before this row), consistent with the standing read that the
veto trades a few avoidable wins for avoiding the correlated-loss tail
elsewhere in the family; own estimate (0.80) also beat the blind mech
second opinion (superforcaster-market-aware, 0.28) on this row, worth
tracking if the pattern repeats. Full grading in RETRO-20260907-0414.

**2026-09-07 12:38Z update (LIGHT tick, cloud; resolve.py settled 2

sd=0.6) vs mid ~0.7985 (bid 0.769/ask 0.861 at record) — model's implied
No belief (0.548) well above the market's implied No (~0.139-0.231),
vetoed as a same-day weather self-model disagreement. Settled Yes, so
the declined No-side counterfactual trade lost.

| Row | est vs mkt | Side | Realizable edge | Result | CF P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wellington 10°C same-day weather (b838efbe4ade) | 0.4522 / 0.7985 | No | +0.317 | Yes | −1.00 |

Net this batch: **−1.00u** (0W/1L). Current mechanical ledger's

same-day weather subclass is now 5 rows, 1W/4L, −17.65 (was 4 rows,
1W/3L, −12.65): this row is a fourth avoided loss (Shanghai, Munich,
Miami, and now Wellington all had their declined side lose), against
Guangzhou as the one case where the veto missed a win. A fixed-sd
same-day point-forecast Gaussian is still net-negative on this exact
bracket shape (4 of 5 declined trades would have lost), consistent with
keeping the veto rather than loosening it — this row reinforces the
standing read, it does not reverse it. Full grading in

two rows). Side split: yes 34 rows/34 trd/9W-25L/+$20.82; no 86
rows/78 trd/39W-39L/+$94.66. Ruling: no boundary change at n=1 on
either row — the SPD miss is a real cost but sits inside the standing
read that yes-side vetoes are the worse-performing class (9W/25L at
~26% win rate vs no-side's 39W/39L at 50%); occasional large yes-side
misses like this one are the expected cost of holding that boundary, not
new evidence to loosen it. The Tokyo row extends the same-day-weather
subclass's run of correct declines. Full grading in
RETRO-20260907-1614.

[MERGE NOTE, operator reconcile 2026-09-07 ~21:00Z: the operator-machine
loop graded the same three rows (Wellington, SPD >=9%, Tokyo) in parallel
between 12:41Z and 20:08Z and its push was rejected; origin's table rows
above are canonical and its duplicate rows are not carried. Two distinct
rulings from the operator-machine retros (RETRO-20260907-1241, -1613) are
carried here as pre-registered, not enacted: (a) Wellington -- the mean was
right and the dispersion wrong; a same-day point forecast sitting ON a
bucket boundary makes P(bucket) ~0.45 by construction, and the market's
0.815 (implied sd ~0.35 after noon) read the afternoon peak better; test
the after-noon sd (0.6 vs ~0.35) once the same-day subclass reaches ~6
settled rows. (b) SPD >=9% and the Gruene >=7% bet WON are one event: the
self-chosen sd (1.2-1.3) for sub-10% parties in this Landtag election was
too tight and the miss was upward; at the next German state election,
grade the small-party vote-share Gaussian rows against a wider,
upward-skewed error before the category is allowed a >0.10 disagreement.]

**2026-09-07 22:14Z update (FULL cycle, cloud; resolve.py settled 1
`outside-view-veto` forecast).** Jeddah 38°C same-day highest-temp bracket
(`39dbfcb80a90`, researched 2026-09-07 02:20Z): open-meteo daily forecast
max 35.0°C (Asia/Riyadh, pre-dawn ~05:15 local, next-day-style sd=1.2 per
playbook), own est P(38°C)=0.0168 vs mid 0.165 (bid 0.14/ask 0.19 at
record) — model's implied No belief (0.983) well above the market's
implied No (~0.81-0.86), vetoed as a weather self-model disagreement.

Current mechanical ledger's outside-view-veto line
(`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason outside-view-veto`,

trades, 49W/64L, pnl +$116.29, brier_delta +0.0267, held-out +$146.68.
Ruling: no boundary change at n=1 — this row is well outside the
same-day-weather subclass's usual afternoon-peak-boundary failure shape
(a pre-dawn forecast on a wide 3°C-out bucket, not a near-boundary same-day
read), and it is a clean win for the self-model, consistent with the
veto correctly avoiding the tail loss elsewhere in the weather category
(still net −$48.60 in the mechanical ledger) rather than evidence to
loosen it.

**2026-09-08 deep retro (resolve.py this pass settled 1
`outside-view-veto` forecast).** Toronto 25°C same-day highest-temp
(`291e9630e91e`, recorded 2026-09-07 00:23Z, next-day-style): open-meteo
point forecast max 25.4°C, N(25.4, 1.2) gives P(25°C)=0.307 vs market
0.57, disagreement 0.26, vetoed under the weather-category moratorium.
Official high was 25°C → Yes. The declined No-side CF trade (No @0.44,
claimed edge 0.253) **LOSES** −$5.00 (−1.00u): a correct decline, and a
clean self-model miss — the point forecast was right (25.4 rounds into
the bucket) and the sd=1.2 dispersion pushed 0.69 of the mass out of a
bucket the market read at 0.57.

this is the second "mean right, dispersion wrong" weather row (after
Wellington, RETRO-20260907-1241's pre-registered sd question): the
Gaussian's sd, not its center, produced the disagreement, and the market
priced the same point forecast with a tighter sd and won. It counts
toward the pre-registered Wellington sd test (re-examine the weather sd
once the same-day subclass reaches ~6 settled rows — this row is
next-day-style, so it informs but does not trigger that test). Within
the veto slice, weather now reads 18 rows, 5W/13L, CF −$53.60, dBrier
+0.0836: the veto's single best category.

**2026-09-09 update (12:3xZ resolve.py, LIGHT tick, cloud; three
`econ-cpi` veto forecasts settled on the China Aug 2026 CPI print — one
`outside-view-veto`, one `wide-spread-veto` fillable, one
`wide-spread-veto` refused as unexecutable).** NBS printed China Aug 2026
CPI YoY at 0.8%, in the 0.7-0.8% bracket. The base-effect anchor used at
record time (Jul YoY 0.5% + Aug seasonal MoM ~+0.3% → ~0.8%) was exact —
first confirmed application of the PPI base-effect projection method
(§"PPI YoY brackets: base-effect projection", 2026-08-11 above) to a
second economic series. Two consensus sources disagreed by one bracket at
record time (tradingeconomics 0.7% vs investing.com/Lundgreen 0.9%); TE's
figure fell in the actual bracket, Lundgreen/investing.com's did not —
n=1, too weak to rule on for future disputes, but the first data point
favors TE when the two conflict.

- **0.7-0.8% bracket** (`19cf14c87979`, outside-view-veto): mixture model
  P=0.33 vs mid 0.485; the No-side apparent edge (~0.15) was built on the
  contradictory consensus and vetoed under gate 2. Settled Yes — the
  declined No bet would have LOST. Correct veto.
- **≥0.9% bracket** (`7bacc91ddf91`, wide-spread-veto): own P=0.38 vs ask
  0.305, spread 0.069 > max_spread 0.06. Settled No — the declined Yes

- **0.5-0.6% bracket, post-print supersede** (`9eff80f25296`,

  edge ~0.20 on No) but the No side had zero asks in the live book (bids

  Check: −2.82−5.00=−7.82 ✓.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=2 on either gate — both counterfactual
trades would have lost, i.e. both declines were correct, consistent with
the standing reads (outside-view-veto's no-side already the stronger
performer at 40W/41L vs yes-side's 9W/25L; wide-spread-veto still thin at
n=6, too small to read). The base-effect method confirmation and the
TE-vs-Lundgreen data point are the more useful findings from this batch
than the veto grading — both are single-instance and carried as
hypotheses, not rules, until a second China CPI print or a second
TE/Lundgreen conflict tests them.

`outside-view-veto` (that row is already graded above at line ~3444).
`core/counterfactual.py` deliberately keeps superseded rows rather than
dropping them, so this is a legitimate second row under
`wide-spread-veto`, distinct from its already-graded successor — just
never manually added. `906a1a65abc8` settled 2026-09-11T07:23:43Z but
the 07:28:35Z TRIGGERED cycle that should have graded it (settlement
duty applies to TRIGGERED cycles same as any other, per
RETRO-20260908-2250) only logged its Sweden Liberals research and
reported "settled 0" — a miss, caught up here one tick late.
`83321f868e0f` is this tick's own genuine new settlement.

Current mechanical ledger's wide-spread-veto line (`core/counterfactual.py
ledger --skip-reason wide-spread-veto`): 9 settled declined forecasts, 7
fillable CF trades, 2 refused, 5W/2L, pnl −$0.81, brier_delta −0.0967,
held-out −$1.50 (was 6/4/2 refused/2W-2L/−$7.82/−0.0326/−$8.51 before
this batch). Side split: yes 6 rows/6 trd/5W-1L/+$4.19 (adds all three
new wins, +$7.00, was 3/3/2W-1L/−$2.82 before this batch); no 3 rows/1
trd/0W-1L/−$5.00 (unchanged this batch). Check: 4.19−5.00=−0.81 ✓;
−2.82+3.47+2.04+1.49=4.18≈4.19 (rounding) ✓.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=9/7 trades — all three new rows are
declined-Yes-side wins, extending the yes-side's edge but still far
short of the ~15-settlement floor. `vance-mention` as a category: n=2,
both won, +$3.54 — both are broad, near-default politician phrases
("campaign", Vance's own stock "tax on tips/overtime" line) rather than
narrow session-specific content, consistent with the broad-phrase side
of the say-the-word split RETRO-20260911-0624 already documented; adds
weak supporting evidence, not a new finding.

**2026-09-15 12:5xZ update (LIGHT tick, operator machine, resolve.py; 1
`wide-spread-veto` forecast settled, plus a catch-up row).** `705c1219decd`
is this tick's genuine settlement: F1 Italian GP safety car (raced Sep6,
market end date Sep13), a fact-final row where the F1.com race report
confirmed a physical Safety Car on lap 2. Declined because the spread
(0.099) exceeded max_spread 0.06. `697a7f4f3799` (Emmys, Last Week
Tonight) settled 2026-09-15T04:13Z and was graded narratively in
RETRO-20260915-0414, but that commit did not extend this table - a
violation of the 2026-08-23 same-commit rule, repaired here.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=11/9 trades. The fact-finality subclass
is now 4 trades, 3W/1L, +$0.65: the veto costs little on fact-final rows
because a 0.90 ask leaves only ~$0.56 to win on a $5 stake, so a tight
spread gate there forgoes small, near-certain gains rather than large
ones. The −$5.00 Emmys row is a thin-edge (+0.05) judgment row the veto
correctly kept out.

right); see the outside-view-veto section below for the cross-family

`outside-view-veto` forecast settled — the Chewy "Consumable" say-the-word

(recorded 2026-09-08 20:21Z, superseding `e7a452fef1be` two minutes
earlier as a label erratum — same 0.93 estimate, reclassified from
`wide-spread-veto` because DEEP-2026-08-14's tiebreak routes a
>0.10-claimed-edge row to outside-view-veto even when the spread gate
also fires): Chewy fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call, own est 0.93 vs ask
0.58 (mid 0.34, an empty-book artifact — bid was 0.10), on the evidence
that "Consumables" is Chewy's own reported revenue segment name, used
5-6 times in the prior-year Q2 transcript. Settled **Yes** — the
declined Yes-side counterfactual trade **wins**. Grading the three
questions the watch item pre-registered: (a) the tool's own subclass
tagger filed this row under `fact-finality`, not unlabelled judgment —
independent, mechanical support for treating "company repeats its own
standard reported vocabulary" as closer to a mechanical base rate than
a behavioural self-model, though n=1 is too thin to act on; (b) the
blind mech (`superforcaster-market-aware`, service 44) gave 0.92 —
within 0.01 of the own estimate — while self-classing the question
`NR-utterance`/`researchability=0.15`, i.e. confidently right on a
question it flagged as unresearchable, the same pattern the still-open
Vance utterance rows show; (c) the 40-share ask at 0.58 was in fact
takeable at the strategy's $5 (~8.6-share) stake size, so the
wide-spread veto alone would have been overcautious here — the correct
blocker was the outside-view veto's >0.10 boundary, which this row does
not argue against. Full narrative in RETRO-20260909-1425.

Mechanical ledger after this batch: 126 settled declined forecasts,
118 fillable CF trades, 84 events, 52W/66L, pnl +$114.43, brier_delta

no 89 rows/81 trd/40W-41L/+$85.47 (unchanged this batch).
Check: 28.96+85.47=114.43 ✓. The subclass reading stays uncomfortable
in the honest direction: fact-finality is now n=29 labeled rows at CF
pnl +$122.08 but subclass dBrier +0.0419 — the wins are real money and
still worse-than-market beliefs on average; the fork bar below, not
this table, decides anything.

Ruling: no boundary change at n=1 within say-the-word (the category
verdict threshold is ~15 settlements) and no change to the relaxation
fork's status — overall brier_delta is still positive (+0.0264, agent
behind market) and this single win doesn't reach the fork's per-fold
recompute threshold on its own. The useful finding is the (a)/(b)/(c)
grading above, carried as a baseline for the still-open Vance utterance
rows (`83321f868e0f`, `906a1a65abc8`) rather than a rule change yet.

Ruling: both declines correct — the counterfactual Yes trades both lose,
so the >0.10 veto again saved money on this event family (now 2 wins /
2 losses for the same-event Sep10 RNC utterance batch: MAGA and Radical
Left won, Endorse and America First lost). The same-session bet
(`e77eef5d06ad`, "Afford", edge 0.06, under the veto) also lost this
tick — see RETRO-20260911-0624 for the full family read. No boundary
change (fork status is deep-retro-only per the section below); this is
a table extension only.

Ruling: both declines correct in isolation (the market beat the
discounted timeline estimate both times), but this is the third sibling
in the same underlying process to do so this week (the third,
`7d43ec49805b`, is a wide-spread-veto row extended in that section
below) — worth a deep retro look at whether "multiple parallel qualifying
channels" markets deserve a higher outside-view floor, but n=3 from one
process is far short of the relaxation fork's 40-event bar and that fork

evenly (3W/3L on the outside-view-veto legs) rather than confirming or
refuting the veto boundary at this n — same "confident middle, thin

BoE row is a clean confirmation that a discretionary MPC vote reads like
the self-model veto class, not a special case: the market (and the
Reuters poll it tracked) beat both the own estimate and the weaker LSEG/

no boundary change - a 0.04 edge was never a veto-sized disagreement, and
the row is on this ledger only because of its label (same treatment as
`9618a7d0872d`). The label and the input both broke the touch-family
ruling above (DEEP-2026-09-01): touch rows are `unvalidated-method`, and
4 of the 6 modeled crypto touch rows recorded since that ruling
(`dde658c37455`, `61bc26d805b6`, `a28637cb4026`, `8d1eb46b7c32`) used a
guessed or swept vol. From this commit every touch estimate comes from
`strategy/tools/touch.py`, which refuses to run without a named, dated
`--vol-source`; the forecast note quotes its output. Settled measured-vol
rows stand at 3 of the 6 the re-grade needs (`edd6af85d6a6`,

sd judgment parameter"): the >=31% row's point estimate (0.81) sat on the
correct side of 0.5 but the veto declined the market-implied No edge
that the loose-sd tail created, and that declined No trade lost because
SPD did clear 31%. The 28-31% sibling declined a Yes-side edge built on
the same Gaussian and also lost, since the outcome landed in the >=31%

`fact-finality` even though the note explicitly argues this is a
self-modeled Gaussian bucket, not a fact-final case — a labeling
mismatch worth a future reconcile pass, not acted on here. The veto
declined this exact class (behavioral point-estimate Gaussian, sd

Ruling: no boundary change at n=2, both wins. Snapshot 2's own estimate
(0.68) was the weaker of the pair — it leaned toward Yes on an unsourced
book jump the row's own note admits it "cannot see behind" — but the veto
still declined the bet on estimate-distrust grounds regardless of
direction, and the declined No-side trade won anyway because the market
itself never fully priced the leak in either (No-side edge stayed
positive, just thinner: +0.324 at snapshot 1 down to +0.091 at snapshot
2). The veto is doing its job independent of estimate quality here; the

55-60m 0.48, 60-65m 0.44, 65-70m 0.03) put the most weight one bracket
below where the market and the actual outcome landed — the row's own
note flagged this gap at record time ("the book sits one bracket above
the trade press") and it played out exactly that way. Box-office's
mechanical-ledger category line stays negative (13 rows, 6W/7L,
-$21.60, brier_delta +0.0117) — this batch is the veto's rationale
playing out as expected, not a new failure mode; the standing veto
stays shut.

**Box-office press-centre rule (RETRO-20261003-0015, evidence
`07bfb21eee33`).** Primetime 19-22M was recorded at 0.82 on a 20.0M press
centre with sd 1.0M; the note flagged a front-loaded opening (Fri incl
previews 32% of the weekend) and a book at 0.65/0.72 below the press, and
kept the shaded ~0.72 view unrecorded. Actuals landed at $18.83M, below
even the studio's $19.2M Sunday estimate. This is the second box-office
bracket where the book beat the trade-press centre (Spider-Man above).
Rule: when Fri-incl-previews share is >= 30% or the book sits below the
press centre, centre on the LOWEST credible press figure, use sd >= 1.5M,
and record that as est_prob. A shade written in the note but not recorded
is the honest estimate left out. Box-office forecasts n=26, mean dBrier
+0.0117. The category stays a standing no-bet self-model.
Tally (RETRO-20261005-2210): post-rule rows 4 (2 events), net dBrier
-0.59. Verity OW 30-32M/32-34M beat the book by -0.40/-0.21 (actual
32-34M, at the press centre; the book over-priced the front-loaded low
end). RE weekend-3 12-13M lost +0.049 at sd 0.6M. On weekend 3 or
later, when press and the Fri multiple agree inside one bracket, use
sd <= 0.4M. Box-office n=32, mean dBrier -0.0083. Still no-bet; review

inside that subclass's noise. The Yes-side row is the more interesting
one: the veto correctly followed its own rule (signing not yet an
immutable fact at research time) on a trade that would have paid
(edge 0.15, and it won) — the known, already-quantified cost of keeping
this gate shut rather than a new failure mode. Full grading in

anyway") was right for a reason beyond the spread-gate mechanics: the
apparent edge was a mid-price illusion. It won on Yes anyway (small,
+$0.68, priced by the bad ask it would have had to pay), which is a
lucky fill outcome, not evidence the mid-based edge was ever real.

Ruling: no boundary change. Same speaker-only Melania base rate family as
the arrival-toast row (`8b059c23c86a`, also won); the veto keeps declining
a real edge on a small-n base rate that keeps paying off, but n=2 same-day
same-family rows is not independent evidence for loosening it.

the table format stabilised. Their P&L has ALWAYS been inside the

Units note for future reconcile reads (DEEP-2026-09-23): per-row CF P&L
in this section's tables is DOLLARS at the $5 flat stake; `reconcile`
prints per-row pnl in 1u = pnl/5 units, so a hand `-5.00` against a
ledger `-1.00u` is the SAME number, not a diff. Of the 71 "C. rows in
both that differ" in today's reconcile run, ~60 are exactly this units
convention; the residue is (i) early rows whose hand edge was quoted
against the MID rather than the realizable ask (Astra 0.783-hand vs
0.056-ledger is the worst; the Lowe's row in the 2026-09-22 REPAIR
documents the same mid-vs-ask illusion), and (ii) rows the fill model
refuses (entry outside [0.02, 0.95] or no bid) where the hand table
recorded a fill anyway. Historical rows are NOT being rewritten to
match — the mechanical ledger is authoritative for every ruling and
gate; the hand table is the narrative index. An operator proposal to
make `reconcile` units-aware and to extend its B-check beyond
outside-view-veto is filed in journal/proposals.md (2026-09-23 pass).

## 2026-10-05 05:27Z: one distribution per event (RETRO-20261005-0527)

Brazil R1: `1d98458aef28` (Sep 21) put Lula most votes at 0.65, and
`b350adc7e95c` (Sep 23) put Lula 2nd at 0.15, which implies Lula 1st near
0.85. The polls did not move 20 points between them. b350 scored the worst
Brier of the 11-row family (0.7225 vs market 0.5162). The Oct 3 family came
from one margin distribution, was coherent, and beat the market on every
row. Rule: when I forecast two or more legs of one event (winner,
runner-up, margin brackets, share thresholds), write one distribution in
the note (for example, margin mean and sd, share mean and sd) and derive
every leg from it. Before recording, check that complementary legs sum to
about 1 and nested legs are ordered. A new leg that implies a different
distribution supersedes the older open siblings in the same cycle.

**Brazil R1 grading data (RETRO-20261005-1017; certified count 99.97%:
Flávio 47.05, Lula 45.14 valid).** Use these numbers for the Oct 25
runoff family. Both are n=1 and stay `unvalidated-method`.

- Poll error split by candidate. The final Datafolha and Quaest valid
  means were Lula 45.5, Flávio 43.5. Lula missed by -0.4 and Flávio by
  +3.5. The right-ward miss came from the minor candidates (polled about
  9-10 combined, Cury 2.89 + Santos 2.24 at the count), not from the PT
  share. PT-share final-poll error is now -1.6, -2.6, -0.4 (2014, 2022,
  2026; mean -1.5). In a multi-candidate round, put the right-ward
  correction on the right candidate's share. Do not take it out of the PT
  share beyond that mean.
- Live-count drift. At 27.9% counted, the per-state extrapolation gave
  F48.78/L43.24. The final was F47.05/L45.14, so the projection missed
  1.7-1.9 points of late Lula-ward drift. The linear-drift continuation
  (F46.1/L45.8) overshot. The final sat at about 0.6-0.7 of linear drift.
  Before any live-count bet, use a drift sd of at least 1.5 points at
  about 30% counted.

Ruling: no boundary change. Both wide-spread rows were sub-floor edges

family-consistency rule from the b350 miss: complementary legs of one
event (e.g. "X finishes 1st" / "X finishes 2nd" in a two-horse race)
must sum to within 0.05 of 1 at record time, or the later record's note
must say which leg is stale. b350 at 0.15 sat next to Lula-1st at 0.65
(sum 0.80) because it used a paired-margin sd with no poll-error term.

## Outside-view-veto relaxation fork (pre-registered, DEEP-2026-09-08, per operator note 2026-09-07 ~20:50Z)

The veto on judgment estimates with claimed edge > 0.10 stays. This fork
defines IN ADVANCE the only evidence that loosens it, so the decision is
never made post hoc. Read the numbers from
`python3 core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason outside-view-veto`
(run `python3 core/screen_replay.py events --limit 200` first so `evts`
is current). ALL THREE must hold:

1. **brier_delta negative (model ahead of the market) in the two MOST
   RECENT consecutive walk-forward folds.** Tightened from the operator
   note's "two consecutive folds" to the two most recent, and the ledger
   argues for the tightening: today's folds f3/f4 carry the slice's best
   CF pnl (+$1.56 / +$91.94) with its WORST calibration (per-fold dBrier
   +0.0488 / +0.0200) — an old good patch must not unlock a carve-out
   while the newest money is being made with worse-than-market beliefs.
   The tool prints fold_pnl but not per-fold dBrier (operator proposal
   filed 2026-09-08 to add it); until then, compute it read-only: sort
   the slice's `--json` rows by ts, split into `folds` equal contiguous
   slices, and average (est−outcome)² − (market−outcome)² per fold.
2. **Net CF pnl positive in those same two folds** (the tool's fold_pnl
   columns, mechanical today).
3. **At least 40 independent gamma events in the slice** (the tool's
   `evts` column).

Status 2026-09-08: **NOT MET.** (1) fails — per-fold dBrier ≈ f0 +0.011,
f1 −0.000, f2 −0.009, f3 +0.049, f4 +0.020 (recipe above; the tool's
own fold boundaries may shift these slightly): the two most recent folds
are both positive. (2) holds on f3/f4 (+$1.56/+$91.94). (3) holds: 80
events ≥ 40. Money without calibration — the fork stays shut.

Status 2026-09-10 (DEEP): **NOT MET.** Slice now 124 rows / 116 CF
trades / 82 events / +$109.91 / overall dBrier +0.0264 (adds the Chewy
ffc3fcdcbaa6 CF win +$3.62 and the China-CPI 19cf14c87979 CF loss −$5
since the 09-08 check). (1) fails — per-fold dBrier by the recipe: f0
+0.0111, f1 −0.0002, f2 −0.0209, f3 +0.0981, f4 +0.0434; the two most
recent folds are both positive (fold boundaries shifted with the 2 new
rows, which is why f3/f4 read worse than the 09-08 quote — same rows,
different splits). (2) holds (fold pnl f3 +$1.56, f4 +$90.56). (3)
holds: 82 events ≥ 40. Same verdict as 09-08: the newest money is
being made with worse-than-market beliefs; the fork stays shut.

Status 2026-09-11 (DEEP): **NOT MET.** Slice now 126 rows / 118 CF
trades / 84 events / +$114.43 / overall dBrier +0.0246 (adds the two
RNC utterance CF wins 36ff9feec021 +$2.58 and 87736f3e8ab9 +$1.94,
settled by the deep retro's resolve run). (1) fails again — per-fold
dBrier by the recipe: f0 +0.0099, f1 −0.0009, f2 −0.0239, f3 +0.0977,
f4 +0.0394; the two most recent folds are both positive. (2) holds
(fold CF pnl f3 +$1.56, f4 +$95.08). (3) holds: 84 events ≥ 40. Fourth
consecutive reading of money-without-calibration; the fork stays shut,
and the fact-finality subclass (n=29, CF +$122.08, dBrier +0.0419)
shows the same shape inside itself.

Status 2026-09-12 (DEEP): **NOT MET.** Slice now 130 rows / 122 CF
trades / 88 events / +$105.30 / overall dBrier +0.0276 (adds the two
Aug-CPI No-leg rows 5a6d5321c25a −$5.00 and 79e72c3002c3 +$5.87, table
extended above). (1) fails — per-fold dBrier by the recipe (all-rows
frame, which reproduces the tool's printed fold pnl −28.81/+38.89/
−7.29/+4.38/+98.14 exactly): f0 +0.0083, f1 −0.0118, f2 +0.0094, f3
+0.0754, f4 −0.0092 — f3 positive, so "two most recent both negative"
fails. (2) holds (fold CF pnl f3 +$4.38, f4 +$98.14). (3) holds: 88
events ≥ 40. Fifth consecutive NOT MET — but note honestly: f4's
dBrier is negative for the FIRST time in five readings. One more batch
of well-calibrated declines would put the two newest folds in genuine
contention; nothing to act on today (fold boundaries shift with n and
the f4 flip is partly the +$5.87 CPI win), but the next deep retro
should recompute before assuming the verdict is static.

Status 2026-09-21 (DEEP): **NOT MET — first reading where BOTH numeric
gates fail.** Slice now 145 rows / 137 CF trades / 101 events / +$66.07
/ overall dBrier +0.0361 (includes the AfD-MV CF win `506bc4c8087e`,
+$1.41, the month's strongest single veto counterexample — graded in
the table above). (1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe (all-rows
frame, 5 contiguous folds of 29): f0 +0.0104, f1 −0.0062, f2 +0.0642,
f3 +0.0323, f4 +0.0798 — the two most recent folds both positive, and
f4 is the slice's worst fold. (2) fails for the first time: tool fold
pnl [−4.01, +4.06, −17.42, +152.84, **−69.40**] — the newest fold is
losing counterfactual money outright (the Mythos by-date cluster,
weather, and the Israel–Lebanon family live there). (3) holds: 101
events ≥ 40, freshly mapped. Sixth consecutive NOT MET, and the
09-12 note's f4-flicker resolved the wrong way once 15 more rows
landed: the newest fifth of the slice is now miscalibrated AND
unprofitable. The AfD-MV win is exactly the row this pre-registration
was built to withstand — a vivid single counterexample must not reopen
a fork that the slice-level arithmetic is failing harder than ever.

Status 2026-09-22 (DEEP): **NOT MET — second consecutive double-gate
failure.** Slice now 151 rows / 143 CF trades / 101 events / +$55.11 /
overall dBrier +0.0342 (adds the six German-election veto rows graded
same-tick by the hourly cycles: Berlin SPD pair CF +$9.03, MV SPD pair
CF −$10.00, Berlin Grüne CF −$5.00, plus the fresh event re-cluster).
(1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe (5 contiguous folds of 30/31):
f0 +0.0093, f1 −0.0063, f2 +0.0841, f3 +0.0386, f4 +0.0449 — the two
most recent folds both positive (boundaries shifted with the 6 new
rows, which is why f2–f4 read differently from the 09-21 quote; same
recipe). (2) fails: tool fold pnl [−8.19, +31.11, −43.96, +122.33,
**−46.18**] (recipe's contiguous split agrees on the sign: f4 −60.37)
— the newest fold still loses CF money. (3) holds: 101 events ≥ 40.
Seventh consecutive NOT
MET. The German veto cluster's vote-share rows are now settled and
split 2W/3L as CF trades — the veto's weakest class (self-built
poll-Gaussian brackets) stayed its weakest class through an election
week that was the fork's best chance to open. The fork stays shut.

Status 2026-09-23 (DEEP): **NOT MET — third consecutive double-gate
failure.** Slice now 162 rows / 154 CF trades / 107 events / +$41.97 /
overall dBrier +0.0349 (adds the window's 9 settled veto rows, net CF
−$32.83 1W/8L: Resident Evil trio −$9.50, Trump-Greenland pair −$3.33,
Opus by-Sep30/exact-Sep22 trio −$15.00, GPT Luna −$5.00, plus the
2026-09-23 DEEP REPAIR backfill of 9 pre-existing rows already inside
the totals). (1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe (5 contiguous
folds of 32/33): f0 +0.0043, f1 +0.0042, f2 +0.0767, f3 +0.0391, f4
+0.0484 — the two most recent folds both positive, f4 worse than
yesterday. (2) fails: tool fold pnl [+7.13, +7.85, +2.02, +84.71,
**−59.74**] — the newest fold's CF loss deepened (−46.18 → −59.74) as
the day's four `ai-model-release` No-reads all resolved Yes. (3)
holds: 107 events ≥ 40. Eighth consecutive NOT MET. The window is the
purest illustration yet of why the fork stays shut: 8 of the day's 9
veto declines SAVED paper money (net CF −$32.83; only the Greenland
Yes-side row would have paid, +$1.67), which is the veto working — and
the same rows are calibration losses against the market, which is gate
1 failing. Money saved by being wrong less expensively than a fill
would cost is not evidence the model should be allowed to bet these.

Status 2026-09-24 (DEEP): **NOT MET — fourth consecutive double-gate
failure.** Slice 164 rows / 156 CF trades / 109 events / +$31.97 /
overall dBrier +0.0359 (adds the 30y-Treasury 5.39% No-read
`03f07792d701` −$5 and the Xi-by-Sep23 arrival-day row `f5e8ad23ec2c`
−$5, both resolved Yes). (1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe (5
contiguous folds of 32/33): f0 +0.0043, f1 +0.0045, f2 +0.0563, f3
+0.0597, f4 +0.0538 — the last THREE folds (everything since
2026-08-25) sit at +0.054 to +0.060, an order of magnitude worse than
f0/f1; divergent reads have got worse, not better. (2) fails: tool fold
pnl [+7.13, +7.85, +2.02, +84.71, **−69.74**]. (3) holds: 109 events.
Ninth consecutive NOT MET. The window's two veto losses share the
recurring shape: a "won't happen by the date" read against a market
pricing the event likely (Treasury rung, Xi arrival — same family as
the four `ai-model-release` No-reads on 09-22/23).

Status 2026-09-25 (DEEP): **NOT MET — fifth consecutive double-gate
failure, but the newest fold improved.** Slice 170 rows / 162 CF trades
/ 113 events / +$89.14 / overall dBrier +0.0309 (adds the window's 6
rows: 30y 5.42/5.45 Yes +$48.96, Xi arrival China 5+ −$5.00 / Ballroom
+$1.76, Xi toast Economy +$3.62 / SI +$7.82; tool reproduced to the
cent). (1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe (5 contiguous folds of
34): f0 −0.0035, f1 +0.0113, f2 +0.0589, f3 +0.0603, f4 **+0.0277**
(was +0.0538) — f4 halved on two events (Xi summit day, one rates
selloff), still positive. (2) fails: tool fold pnl [+10.90, −5.92,
+12.19, +72.37, **−0.40**]. (3) holds: 113 events. Tenth consecutive
NOT MET. The +$57 CF jump in one day is longshot payoff variance
(+$40.45 from one 0.106 fill on the 30y 5.45 rung), not calibration:
read dBrier, not CF pnl. Note: 4 of 162 CF trades (net −$6.49,
incl. `7771a4b3b7ac` +$8.51) had non-positive realizable edge at the
ask and could never have been placed; immaterial to the verdict.

Status 2026-09-26 (DEEP): **NOT MET — eleventh consecutive; gate 2 now
holds, gate 1 regressed.** Slice 173 rows / 165 CF trades / 116 events /
71W-94L / +$87.41 / overall dBrier +0.0312 (adds Xi-dinner Ballroom
`f0790f007a85` −$5.00, Melania `5ee6e91cd3d2` +$1.94, Yabloko
`56ed434261a5` +$1.33; tool output, held-out +$81.52). (1) fails: per-fold dBrier by the recipe
(5 contiguous folds of 34-35): f0 −0.0035, f1 +0.0058, f2 +0.0770, f3
**+0.0406**, f4 **+0.0363** (f4 was +0.0277 yesterday — the halving did
not hold one day later). (2) holds: tool fold pnl [+5.90, −1.99, +39.93,
+36.92, +6.66]. (3) holds: 116 events. Same reading as every day since
09-08: CF money without calibration. No-side f3/f4 CF pnl is now
−$5.95/−$17.16, so the No-side "nothing announced" candidate shape named
below is currently the weaker side, not the stronger one.

If the bar is ever MET: do not loosen the veto wholesale. Propose a
NARROW carve-out for the best-evidenced sub-class only (current
candidate shape: No-side timeline theses of the "nothing announced"
kind), with a disagreement band, standard floors, one trade per event,
and a kill switch armed in the same commit, per the mechanical-econ
template below. Hourly cycles extend the table and never act on this
fork; only a deep retro may propose the carve-out.


## Mechanical-econ carve-out (enacted DEEP-2026-08-28, first loosening of the outside-view veto)

A candidate may bet a >0.10 disagreement with the market — which the
outside-view veto otherwise forbids — only when ALL of the following
hold:

1. **Mechanical official print:** the market resolves off a scheduled
   official release (statistics agency, central bank) with a numeric,
   interpretation-free criterion. No behavioral self-models (Musk,
   box-office, social-post counts, weather-Gaussian), no
   prelim-anchored guesses, regardless of claimed edge.
2. **Named, reachable external benchmark, quoted at research time:**
   the estimate is a distribution around a published consensus/survey
   number or an official prior series with a validated revision/variance
   history, and the rationale QUOTES the benchmark (source + number)
   before the print. A self-built Gaussian, or one whose variance input
   was unreachable (a recorded property-2 failure), does NOT qualify —
   this is the UMich lesson (0/2, −2.00u): property-2 failure at
   forecast time predicts veto-was-right at settlement.
3. **Band 0.10–0.20 only.** Disagreement above 0.20 stays vetoed
   outright — the counterfactual ledger's worst losses all live there.
4. **Standard floors unchanged** (min_edge, max_spread, flat $5), and
   at most ONE carve-out bet per print event: pick the single best leg,
   no sibling ladders (CONN@CHI / ai-leaderboard correlated-exposure
   lesson).

**Gate-2 variance clause (DEEP-2026-08-29):** the variance input is part
of the benchmark, not a free parameter. A distribution whose mean is a
quoted consensus but whose dispersion is an unsourced round number is
half a self-model — the NFP bracket set (release 2026-09-05, first live
carve-out candidate) records in its own watch item that the edge SIGN
flipped on the 70k-vs-90k std choice for several legs, and UMich (0/2,
−2.00u) is what an unbenchmarked spread does at settlement. A carve-out
bet therefore requires the rationale to quote a source for dispersion
too (e.g., trailing realized consensus-miss spread computed from named
release/consensus history), quoted at research time like the mean.
No sourced dispersion → the row stays forecast-only regardless of
apparent edge. This narrows gate 2; it loosens nothing.

**NFP tail-risk flag (2026-09-04, RETRO-20260904-1613):** the Aug 2026
NFP print landed >=150k against a cited consensus of ~53-56k — both this
book's sourced sd=72k model and the market itself gave that outcome only
~6-7%, and it happened. The standard-floor No bet on 0-50k (84167af841f7)
won anyway, but for the wrong reason (the model's mean had moved DOWN on
an ADP miss right before a large beat) — not evidence the sd-sourcing
method works, more a reminder that a Gaussian with a survey-sourced sd is
still likely to underweight genuine headline-NFP outliers. Its same-day
sibling, the UR 4.1% No bet (609c98073a77), lost because its sd=0.12 was
too WIDE relative to the market's 0.09 on an exact-bracket print — the
two results point in opposite directions on "is my sourced dispersion too
narrow or too wide," which at n=2 is not a basis for changing any sd
input. Flagging only: don't read the NFP win as validating wide sds, and
don't read the UR loss as validating tight ones, until more of this exact
shape (sourced-sd self-model, standard floor, headline econ print)
settles.

**Pre-registered kill switch:** after 4 settled carve-out EVENTS or 6
settled carve-out BETS (whichever comes first), if net realizable P&L
≤ 0 or the agent is not ahead on dBrier in a majority, the carve-out
reverts in full and the sub-class folds back into the general veto. Each
carve-out bet is audited by the next deep retro. Evidence basis at
enactment: fired-veto counterfactuals Japan GDP +0.85u / PCE +0.04u /
BoK +2.03u (all agent-ahead) vs UMich −2.00u (excluded by gate 2); the
margin is one bad print wide, which is why the kill switch is sized this
small.

**BoK watch-item grading notes (pre-registered asks (a) and (b)):**
(a) live-CLOB-convergence-ahead-of-search — YES, reusable, but as a VETO
input, not an edge: the 01:25Z cycle saw the book collapse to hike-0.972
before any indexed news confirmed the announcement. For scheduled
announcements on liquid books, the CLOB is structurally faster than
WebSearch indexing, which means (i) a cheap "the market already knows"
detector exists (quote the book before claiming an info edge on anything
scheduled), and (ii) it is one more reason the GTA-VI-style liquid-book
"market hasn't noticed" claim should be treated as self-refuting — this is
now the second independent line of evidence for the thin/stale-book
credibility condition pre-registered on c6f16acc55d9. (b) TRIGGERED-vs-
FULL race on the same catalyst: n=1, the rebase collision was resolved
correctly by dropping the redundant less-evidenced row; no coordination
rule until it recurs — the existing cycle-start collision guard stays as
is.

**Gate-2 supporting evidence, Bank of Israel Aug/Sept decision
(RETRO-20260901-1617):** two labels for the same rescheduled meeting
(Aug-dated pair 631d616bf794/64c89e162ea1, Sept-dated pair
4a5f7889b9de/a989d14ba8ff) both settled the same way — BoI cut, not held —
against a qualitative-only "most forecasters expect a hold" read with no
numeric survey found, on both my estimate (0.20/0.15 for cut) and the
market's price (0.24/0.12). Both forecasts correctly stayed in the
ordinary no-edge path (never eligible for the carve-out — gate 2 requires
a quoted numeric consensus, not a qualitative one) and risked no capital.
First concrete instance of a qualitative-only central-bank consensus
missing the actual decision: n=1 real event, no rule change, but it
validates gate 2's numeric-survey requirement rather than arguing for
loosening it — a case exactly like this is what gate 2 exists to keep out
of the carve-out.

**Gate-2 supporting evidence, August CPI cluster (RETRO-20260911-1615):**
10 forecast-only rows on the Aug-2026 CPI bracket ladders (headline MoM,
core MoM, headline YoY, core YoY) all shared a Cleveland Fed nowcast as
sourced mean but an unsourced sd (Knotek-Zaman recalled from memory, PDF
unreadable at research time) — correctly excluded from the carve-out by
gate 2. At settlement (headline MoM 0.4%, core MoM 0.3%, headline YoY
3.4%, core YoY 2.4%), the market's tighter implied sd (~0.07) put more
probability mass on the winning bracket than the own model's wider
unsourced sd on 3 of 4 independent bracket families (headline MoM 0.34 vs
market 0.465, headline YoY 0.345 vs 0.415, core YoY 0.376 vs 0.425); only
core MoM matched the market, and that leg's edge came from a flagged
directional mean-shift off the raw nowcast ("market ladder skews up," own
mean 0.22 vs nowcast 0.20), not from the sd choice. Fifth line of evidence
that an unsourced dispersion input underperforms the market's own implied
spread — gate 2 stands. Forward note: shifting a nowcast-centered
Gaussian's MEAN toward the market's bracket-ladder shape is a legible,
gate-1-compatible adjustment; substituting a recalled-from-memory SD for
the market's implied one is not, and should not be treated as
"benchmarked" just because the mean half of the same model is sourced.

**2026-08-21 update (18:11Z settlement): the Aug14-21 Musk weekly set's
two >0.10-disagreement legs both settled, both LOST.** 240-259
(cd3af116ed2a, No side, bid 0.252 vs est 0.16) lost to the actual count
landing in that bracket — the model underweighted the bucket the market
priced correctly. 280-299 (cc08840449e9, Yes side, ask 0.169 vs est 0.31)
lost — the model overweighted the opposite tail, the same "confident
middle/tail overweight" shape flagged as a watch pattern since
RETRO-20260817-1913. Two more 0-for-2 behavioral self-model rows extend
the pattern the Aug 18 fork already called MIXED-but-veto-stays; this is
off-fork confirmation, not a new decision (no fork reopened).

**Totals (2026-08-21, updated 18:11Z settlement): 22 realizable
disagreement trades, 8W/14L, net −7.42u (−$37.10 at $5 flat).** Sub-classes
now split by MODEL GENERATION, because the 2026-08-15/16 additions are the
first settled rows from the 14-day empirical bootstrap (every earlier
self-model row was Gaussian or naive): pre-bootstrap self-model 1W/7L
(−6.39u); bootstrap 2W/1L (+2.06u) — the three bootstrap rows are all
complementary brackets on ONE realized tweet count (40-64 and 65-89 both
lost, <40 won — one realized count, arithmetic ties all three legs
together), so this is effectively n=1 independent outcome, off-fork, and
buys no veto exception by itself (the <40 leg's miss — est 0.0146 on the
outcome that happened — is exactly the "confident middle, wrong tails"
shape to watch for on the still-open Aug 18 weekly fork; see
RETRO-20260817-1913). Wide-spread rows: 1 realizable, won (+0.15u); the
spread rule's entire settled cost remains one foregone ~+$0.77 win. Box-
office rows (new 2026-08-18, see sub-class paragraph below) are pre-
bootstrap-generation Gaussian self-model, 2W/2L (+0.75−1.00+1.00−1.00 =
−0.25u), folded into the side split below but NOT into the behavioral
pre-bootstrap self-model 1W/7L line (different domain, tracked
separately). Side split, recomputed row-by-row from the table above
(**correction #2, DEEP-2026-08-19**: the 18:16Z retro updated the ledger
totals to 20 trades but left THIS side split at its 17-trade values
("1W/6L −4.50u / 6W/4L +0.92u") — the second stale-subtotal instance in
two days, same failure class as the +0.17u error corrected 2026-08-18
01:12Z. Re-summed row-by-row from the table above, all 20 realizable
rows: the three rows added 16:14–18:16Z are HD earnings (65aea7cd91f4,
No-side, −1.00), Musk wk 180-199 (99feadecc33b, Yes-side, −1.00) and
Musk wk 220-239 (cf16f6424af7, No-side, +0.16)): Yes-side 1W/7L
(−5.50u); No-side 7W/5L (+0.08u), as of the 2026-08-18 settlement. The
honest read at that point: the No-side stream was FLAT, not "solidly
positive" — the +0.92u lead was three settlements old the moment it was
cited. 7W/5L at +0.08u over 12 correlated rows was indistinguishable
from zero edge; what survived was only the asymmetry (Yes-side
disagreements uniformly bad, −5.50u at 1W/7L). The 2026-08-14
No-side-sweep proposal's evidence was updated accordingly — the
instrument argument (machine slice instead of hand-summed subtotals) is
now proven twice, even as the edge claim weakens. Brier view: self-model
n=11 mean dBrier still weighted down by the <40 miss (box-office rows are
forecast-only entries, not bets, so they don't change this bet-brier
figure).

**2026-08-21 update:** two more rows settled, Musk wk 240-259
(cd3af116ed2a, No-side, −1.00) and Musk wk 280-299 (cc08840449e9,
Yes-side, −1.00) — re-summed row-by-row from the full table above, all 22
realizable rows: **Yes-side 1W/8L (−6.50u); No-side 7W/6L (−0.92u)**. The
No-side stream — the one slice that had survived as "flat, not
positive" — is now net NEGATIVE for the first time. With only 6 No-side
losses total this is still a small-n read (schedule.json's own guardrail:
no category verdict below ~15), but the asymmetry claim itself needs
restating: it is no longer "Yes-side bad, No-side flat," it is "both
sides net negative, Yes-side worse." The 2026-08-14 No-side-sweep
proposal's evidence should be re-checked against this flip at the next
deep retro rather than re-cited at its stale +0.08u figure. Model
generation for the two new rows is not cleanly classified here (the
underlying note describes a week-avg/last-24h pace blend, not clearly
either the pure pre-bootstrap Gaussian or the pure 14-day resample
bootstrap) — leave the per-generation sub-totals below as last updated
2026-08-18 and resolve the classification at the next deep retro rather
than guess it on a light tick.

**Generation ruling (DEEP-2026-08-22, resolving the deferral above):**
both new rows are GAUSSIAN generation. The recorded notes (cd3af116ed2a,
cc08840449e9) describe a week-avg/last-24h pace blend fed into a normal
approximation (mean~274, sd~15) — Gaussian machinery on a point pace
estimate, no resampling anywhere, so they extend the behavioral
pre-bootstrap/Gaussian self-model line, not the bootstrap line:
**behavioral Gaussian 1W/7L (−6.39u) → 1W/9L (−8.39u)** (sole win still
Musk 160-179 +0.61). Full per-generation re-sum of all 22 realizable
rows, verified row-by-row against the table: behavioral Gaussian 1W/9L
−8.39u (SC Nordone, SC Fry, MN Flanagan, MN Craig, Musk 120-139,
140-159, 160-179, 180-199, wk 240-259, wk 280-299); bootstrap 3W/2L
+1.22u (Musk 2d 40-64/65-89/<40 + wk 180-199/220-239 — all Musk counts,
~2 independent realized outcomes); mechanical-econ Gaussian 1W/0L +0.85u
(Japan GDP); mechanical wide-spread 1W/0L +0.15u (PPI 5.3%); box-office
Gaussian 2W/2L −0.25u; earnings 0W/1L −1.00u (HD). Sum = −7.42u ✓
matches the ledger total. The structural read this buys: every settled
counterfactual PROFIT sits in mechanical or bootstrap classes; the
behavioral point-estimate Gaussian is 1-for-10 — the sharpest statement
yet of why the social-media-postcount bar and the >0.10 veto exist, and
of what the Aug 28/29 fork is actually deciding (whether MECHANICAL
disagreements deserve different treatment, not behavioral ones).

**2026-08-23 update (DEEP): TI VISION/Yandex row added, one settlement
late.** The row settled 2026-08-22 13:14Z and RETRO-20260822-1314 graded
it narratively ("veto correct, would-be loss avoided") but did NOT extend
this table — the first time a settled veto row was omitted from the table
entirely (the two 2026-08-18/19 incidents were stale sub-totals, not
missing rows). Row arithmetic: est(Yandex) 0.383 vs mkt
0.235, Yes-side buy at recorded ask 0.24, realizable edge +0.143, Yandex
lost → −1.00u. **Totals now 23 realizable trades, 8W/15L, net −8.42u**;
side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side 1W/9L −7.50u; No-side 7W/6L
−0.92u** (unchanged, no No-side settlements). Generation ruling: this is
a FIFTH class — a non-sharp odds-blend (internally-inconsistent
aggregator + play-stats model, no sharp book; the recorded note itself
flagged the data-quality problem) — not a self-model of any generation
and not a clean book-devig. Per-generation re-sum: behavioral Gaussian
1W/9L −8.39u; bootstrap 3W/2L +1.22u; mechanical-econ Gaussian 1W/0L
+0.85u; mechanical wide-spread 1W/0L +0.15u; box-office Gaussian 2W/2L
−0.25u; earnings 0W/1L −1.00u; non-sharp odds-blend 0W/1L −1.00u. Sum
−8.42u ✓. The structural read sharpens: every profitable class is
mechanical or bootstrap; every class whose benchmark or model is
narrative, behavioral, or data-quality-flagged is a net loser.
**Mechanical rule (this miss's fix): a settlement retro on any
outside-view-veto or wide-spread-veto row must extend this table — row,
re-summed totals, side split — in the SAME commit as the retro; a veto
retro without a table edit is a violation on its face, same
copy-the-arithmetic pattern as the weld and cap rules.**

**2026-08-24 update (16:22Z): BTC touch-$80k row added, first settled
touch-anytime-family instance.** Driftless GBM barrier-touch self-model
using real Deribit DVOL (~35% ann., dated ~Aug7) instead of an
order-of-magnitude vol guess — the named hypothesis was whether a
*measured* vol input makes this architecture trustworthy where the
WTI/Gold/gas-price touch-anytime family (still open, unsettled) uses
guessed vol. est P(No)=0.5034 vs ask 0.388, edge +0.115, outside-view-veto,
no bet. Bitcoin touched $80k before Sep 1 (early resolution, as
touch-anytime brackets do), so the No side LOST — the veto correctly
blocked a $1 loss. Generation: this is a diffusion/barrier-touch
self-model, not a point-Gaussian one, but shares the "unvalidated tail
probability, self-model distrust" root cause as the pre-bootstrap
Gaussian family — folded into the No-side split below rather than a new
per-generation line, since n=1 doesn't yet justify a sixth class; revisit
the classification once the WTI/Gold/gas siblings settle and there is
more than one touch-family row to compare. Real DVOL did not rescue the
architecture on this instance — same "confident middle, wrong tails"
failure shape as the guessed-vol members. **Totals now 24 realizable
trades, 8W/16L, net −9.42u**; side split re-summed row-by-row: **Yes-side
1W/9L −7.50u; No-side 7W/7L −1.92u** (−7.50 + −1.92 = −9.42 ✓, unchanged
Yes-side, one new No-side loss).

**New sub-class, first instance (2026-08-17): mechanical-econ Gaussian
self-model.** Japan GDP 0.0-0.8% is a Gaussian model on an official macro
print (Normal around a named survey consensus, unvalidated sd), same model
generation as the pre-bootstrap SC/MN/Musk rows but a different domain —
those are behavioral/political predictions, this is a mechanical release
the way econ-cpi/econ-ppi bets already are (DEEP-2026-08-14 "Known
unknowns" mechanical-econ family, pooled brier_delta -0.0104 over 27
settled bets/forecasts). This one row won at +0.2125 realizable edge,
opposite the "0-for-multiple" framing the pre-bootstrap self-model rows
established — but n=1 in this specific sub-class is not evidence of
anything on its own (schedule.json's own guardrail: no category verdict
below ~15 settlements). Track separately going forward; do not fold into
the pre-bootstrap self-model 1W/7L line above, and do not grant a veto
exception on this single row.

**New sub-class, first instance (2026-08-18): box-office Gaussian
self-model.** Four of the six-row box-office watch item (Oak Street
17-20m, Spider-Man BND <66m/66-68m/68-70m) settled this tick — same model
generation as the pre-bootstrap SC/MN/Musk rows (Normal around a
tracker/studio-guide central estimate, unvalidated sd) but a third
distinct domain: not behavioral/political, not a mechanical macro print,
but entertainment-revenue self-modeling against same-day tracking data
the agent lacks. 2W/2L, net −0.25u — the wins came on the No side where
the model correctly judged the market's bracket-mass placement wrong; the
losses were both Yes-side bets where the model trusted its own Gaussian
over the market's tighter same-day-tracking-informed price (see
Spider-Man 66-68m: 0.23 mid-disagreement, "textbook case for the veto,"
and it did lose — but the market's true edge showed up on the Yes-side
picks, not the No-side ones, splitting this set unlike the uniform
pre-bootstrap behavioral losses). Per the schedule.json watch item, keep
these OUT of the Aug 18 weekly bootstrap-fork claims — this is a
different generation AND a different domain question. n=4 (2 realized
independent events: Oak Street opening weekend, Spider-Man 3rd weekend)
is far below any category-verdict bar; track separately, do not fold into
the pre-bootstrap self-model 1W/7L line, no veto exception granted. Fifth
row (20-23m, no-edge skip, not in this ledger) and PAW Patrol (no-edge
skip, already settled 2026-08-17, not in this ledger) round out the
six-row set; **set now fully settled (RETRO-20260818-0717): both no-edge
rows resolved consistent with their price (no counterfactual entry, no
calibration surprise at n=2), watch item closed.**

**New sub-class, first instance (2026-08-18): earnings-beat
external-consensus blend.** HD earnings (65aea7cd91f4) is neither a
self-generated Gaussian nor a mechanical-econ survey-consensus model —
it blends an external analyst consensus (Zacks non-GAAP EPS estimate)
with the company's own historical beat rate and the Zacks ESP+Rank
combo's historical conversion rate. Settled Yes; the model's No-side veto
trade (est 0.68 vs bid 0.81, edge +0.13) lost, −1.00u (RETRO-20260818-1614).
n=1, far below any category-verdict bar; track separately, do not fold
into either the pre-bootstrap self-model or mechanical-econ lines, no
veto exception implied by this single row — but it extends the "0-for-
multiple large-claimed-edge" pattern into a fourth distinct model
generation.

**Decision implications:** (1) the 0.10 veto boundary stays — the full
ledger is now net −4.58u (updated 2026-08-18 16:14Z, HD earnings row
added) and the positive sub-slices are one correlated bootstrap event
triple (2W/1L, not a clean 2W/0L), one n=1 mechanical-econ row, and a
split 2W/2L box-office set that nets slightly negative, against a new
n=1 earnings-beat loss; (2) whether the
bootstrap deserves different treatment is exactly the pre-registered fork
(§social-media-postcount), decided by the Aug 18 weekly legs — not here,
not on off-fork rows;
(3) the path to more placements is still expanding the mechanical/No-side
realizable classes (econ prints, cross-market arithmetic); (4) every
counterfactual claim uses this table's arithmetic — side, realizable ask,
spread — never a narrative "would have lost/won". Counting note
(DEEP-2026-08-17): the two settled Japan GDP rows (d684f9caff81 veto,
b9170b30b10b no-edge) are complementary brackets on ONE print — one
independent outcome, same convention as the Musk 2-day pair; only the
veto row enters this table.

**Pre-registered fork: mechanical-econ Gaussian veto sub-class
(DEEP-2026-08-17).** The sub-class opened by Japan GDP (a Gaussian around
a NAMED survey/consensus benchmark on an official mechanical print, vetoed
at >0.10 disagreement) has three more tests already queued: the PCE
cluster's vetoed legs (settle Aug 26), the BoK rate read (a8fa1e2ac41d,
Aug 27), and the Canada GDP set (Aug 28, EXCLUDING fe954ed9f325 — recorded
inverted, graded as process error). Decision rule, fixed now so it is not
made post-hoc: **at DEEP-2026-08-28/29, if the sub-class has ≥3
independent settled events (Japan GDP counts as one) with net realizable
counterfactual P&L > 0 AND the agent ahead on dBrier in a majority, file
an operator-visible playbook change proposing a NARROW carve-out**
(candidate shape: mechanical official prints with a named external survey
benchmark may bet at min_edge inside the 0.10–0.20 disagreement band,
standard floors and spread rule unchanged; pure behavioral self-models —
Musk, box-office — stay vetoed regardless). **If the record is net
negative or mixed, the veto stays untouched and the sub-class folds into
the general self-model line.** Readings for both outcomes are hereby
pre-registered; hourly cycles extend the table but do NOT act on this
fork early — the same discipline as the Musk Aug 18 fork. Rationale: the
mechanical-econ family is the only consistently agent-favorable region
(pooled forecast dBrier −0.0139 over 29 settled rows as of today,
sibling-correlated so effective n is smaller), and the veto's only
settled fire in this family cost +0.85u of realizable counterfactual.
n=1 grants nothing; the fork defines what WOULD.

**Exploration budget, UMich Consumer Sentiment brackets (2026-08-16 07:15Z,
first test of this category).** Hypothesis: mechanical monthly print (final
release Aug 28), same fact-finality profile as the econ-cpi/econ-ppi/econ-pce
family that's the only settled-positive family so far — but this print has a
PRELIMINARY release (Aug ~15) ahead of the final, so the open question is
whether the prelim-to-final revision is a reachable, model-able benchmark or
another self-model trap. Prelim August print (WebSearch): 51.0, down from
54.5 consensus / July final 55.2, on a broad-based deterioration narrative
(Hsu: short-term business-conditions expectations -11%, long-term -17%).
Tried to source a clean historical prelim-vs-final revision series to model
the Aug 28 final: FRED (`fredgraph.csv`), advisorperspectives.com, and
tradingeconomics.com's data table all 403'd/were unextractable from this
runner (same site-blocking pattern as the existing forebet/oddsportal/
Metaculus entries) — only WebSearch news summaries were reachable, n=3
recent months, one containing an internally-inconsistent arithmetic claim
("7.5-point increase" that didn't match the two cited numbers). **Result:
reachable for the point print (Yes) but NOT reachable for a trustworthy
revision-variance benchmark (No)** — property 2 fails on the model input,
not the headline fact. Built a deliberately fattened N(50.5, 3.5) anyway to
see the shape: it still couldn't reproduce the market's ~13% combined mass
on the >=58 brackets (own siblings.py sum_check 0.982, a well-calibrated
book) without an unreasonably large sd — the same Gaussian-tail-
underweighting mechanism already confirmed and fixed-via-bootstrap on the
Musk brackets (2026-08-13/14), now found in a second, unrelated bracket
category on first contact. Two brackets cleared the >0.10 outside-view
boundary on this admittedly-shaky model (below-49.0 edge +0.157, ALSO
spread-vetoed at 0.171; 49.0-51.9 edge -0.109, spread fine at 0.05) —
declined both per the veto. The two most liquid/tradeable brackets
(49-51.9 ask 0.43, 52-54.9 ask 0.27, spreads 0.05/0.01) showed only
sub-floor edges (-0.109 already counted, -0.030) once measured against the
live CLOB ask rather than gamma mid. Net: 0 bets, 7 forecasts recorded
(a5703b36d60a…d5dcc12cdabe). **Category ruled in as mechanically reachable
or the headline print, ruled out for self-modeling the revision without a
better vintage dataset** — if revisited, only with either (a) a reachable
prelim-to-final revision history (try `alfred.stlouisfed.org` specifically,
untried this pass — ALFRED vintages differ from the plain FRED series URL
that 403'd), or (b) treating the market's own book as the prior and looking
only for a genuine information edge on top of it, not a from-scratch
distribution.

*Sep 2026 settlement tally (RETRO-20260925-1612):* the recalled
prelim-to-final revision model (prelim 47.8, sd ~1.45, 15/24 inside,
unsourced) went 2/2 vs the mid on its first settled test: 46.0-48.9
own 0.64 vs 0.605 won (dBrier -0.026), 43.0-45.9 own 0.13 vs 0.185
lost-as-predicted (dBrier -0.017); final 48.1 (+0.3 revision). Sibling
brackets of one print = effective n=1, so the ruling above stands:
forecast-only, `unvalidated-method`, no bets. It grants nothing until a
sourced revision history (ALFRED) backs the sd, or >=4 independent
monthly prints of the recalled model beat the mid.

**Exploration budget, one-off exhibition match via single-book WebSearch,
first test (2026-08-16 11:18Z).** Named property: does a one-off exhibition
fixture with no dedicated odds-api league feed still have a trustworthy
single-book line reachable by WebSearch (as opposed to the odds-aggregator
"best odds across bookmakers" trap already ruled a no-go, Boca/Estudiantes
2026-08-05), and does a 3-way h2h devig map cleanly onto a PM derivative
submarket when the pool has no plain moneyline submarket for the event? FA
Community Shield Arsenal vs Man City (today, not in the-odds-api's
`soccer_epl` fixture list — a separate exhibition, not a league match).
WebSearch surfaced a DraftKings-network article (dknetwork.draftkings.com,
DK's own staff analysis piece quoting DK's own line, not an aggregator) with
a clean 3-way moneyline: Arsenal +145 / Draw +240 / City +155 → power devig
fair Arsenal 0.3764 / Draw 0.2633 / City 0.3603. The PM pool for this event
has no plain "Arsenal wins"/"City wins" submarket, only derivative ones
(draw-yes/no, five O/U total lines, BTTS, neither-scores-first); of those,
only draw-yes/no maps directly onto a devigged h2h number without needing a
goals-distribution model. PM draw market (3449517) ask Yes 0.29/bid 0.28,
ask No 0.72/bid 0.71 — edges No +0.0167, Yes -0.0267, both well under
min_edge_book_devig 0.07. **Result: reachable** (single named-book source
held up, no aggregation-mixing needed) **and the devig-to-derivative-
submarket mapping works cleanly for a draw/no-draw split specifically** —
but **no edge**, the same efficient-market pattern as every other liquid PM
sports book tested (UFC, MLB, tennis). The O/U and BTTS submarkets on this
same event were left unresearched: matching them would require a total-
goals number from the same single book, which this source didn't provide,
and building one from a different book would repeat the cross-book-mixing
trap — a genuinely separate, still-untested question (does a single book
publish a matching total alongside its h2h for an exhibition fixture) if
revisited.

**Exploration budget, AAA gas-price touch-anytime brackets, first test
(2026-08-17 00:24Z).** New candidate class found in scan: "Will gas hit $X
(Low/High) by August 31?" (event 769509, 8 sibling legs, resolves Yes if the
AAA US national-average regular-gas price touches the threshold on ANY day
from market creation to end date — a barrier/touch condition, not a
point-in-time print). Named property: is a mechanical, officially-sourced
(AAA) commodity threshold, with weekly public data (AAA newsroom, EIA),
reachable and modelable the way the mechanical-econ family (CPI/PPI) has
been. Current price $4.0656 (Aug 16); the observed window since market
creation (Jul 27 $4.096 -> Aug 16 $4.0656, weekly n=4) stayed inside a tight
~$4.00-4.10 band. Built a no-drift diffusion/barrier-touch model (reflection
principle) off a daily sigma estimated from those 4 weekly deltas (~2.1c/day,
explicitly an UNVALIDATED small-n estimate, same caveat class as the Japan-
GDP and UMich-sentiment SD choices) — gives near-zero touch probability for
every one of the 8 thresholds (nearest legs $3.90/$4.25 at 3.5%/1.9%, the
rest <0.5%), while live asks price every leg at 9-29%. **Result: the
disagreement is large (>0.10) AND uniform across all 8 siblings
simultaneously** (not one outlier leg) — the same shape as the already-
documented siblings.py sum-check caveat (2026-08-05: thin/placeholder
pricing produces sum-check flags that are a data-quality tell, not an edge)
and a fourth instance of the Gaussian/diffusion-tail-underweighting failure
already confirmed on Musk brackets and UMich sentiment. Book quality was
mixed — the nearest leg ($3.90) actually has a real book (spread 0.02, ask
depth 200), so this isn't purely a thin-book artifact there, which makes the
uniform-gap read (self-model distrust) the operative reason over
wide-spread-veto; several other legs are separately thin (null bid, spread
up to 0.20). Declined all 8 as `outside-view-veto` (self-model + large
disagreement, both-apply case per the DEEP-2026-08-14 taxonomy rule —
estimate distrust dominates), 8 forecasts recorded (e2cbca37fe88, plus 7
siblings same batch), 0 bets. **Category ruled in as mechanically reachable
and worth tracking (public AAA/EIA source, new touch-barrier structure not
seen before) but the naive small-n diffusion self-model is not trustworthy
enough to act on here, exactly like the other self-model categories** — if
revisited, needs either a validated historical daily-price series (not just
4 weekly points) to get a real sigma, or evidence the 24h-volume=0 legs
specifically are seeded/placeholder (would explain the wide-leg gaps without
needing a sigma fix at all, leaving only the $3.90 leg's real-book gap to
explain).

**Odds-API domestic-league soccer (EPL), first clean-feed test (2026-08-17
10:2xZ).** Named property, per the exploration-budget prioritization
guidance above (reachable EXTERNAL benchmark, not another self-model
instance): does `core/odds.py`'s clean feed cover a full domestic soccer
league slate the way it already does MLB/WNBA, closing the gap where prior
soccer book-devig tests were all one-off WebSearch lookups vulnerable to
the cross-book-mixing and stale-line traps (§Search-result traps)? EPL's
opening weekend (10 fixtures, Aug 21-24, 5-8 days out) is fully covered by
`soccer_epl` — same 9 books as MLB/WNBA, same fixtures PM's pool lists.
Single-book (BetMGM, present on every fixture) power devig of h2h + totals
across all 10 games (24 win/draw markets + 7 totals lines, 31 PM markets
total, one `odds` API call, 2 credits): every edge (devig fair vs PM mid)
sat in **-0.018 to +0.012**, the same 0.00-0.02 efficiently-tracked band as
MLB spreads (n=21), UFC moneylines (n=3), and ATP/WTA tennis (n=3) — no
candidate approached min_edge 0.04, let alone min_edge_book_devig 0.07.
**Result: reachable** (single-book multi-market coverage matches the PM
pool 1:1, no cross-book-mixing needed, unlike the earlier WebSearch-only
soccer traps) **but no edge** — domestic-league soccer joins the
efficiently-tracked-book list. 31 forecasts recorded (skip-reason
`no-edge`, fit-score 5, `soccer`/`soccer-totals` categories,
`strategy/funnel.jsonl` 2026-08-17T10:20:00Z) for calibration; 0 bets.
Category ruled in as clean-feed-coverable (a new use of an already-proven
pipe, not a new self-model risk) — the open question if revisited is
whether a THINNER domestic league (outside the-odds-api's top-tier
coverage) shows a wider gap than EPL's tight one.

**Exploration-budget prioritization (DEEP-2026-08-17).** Three of the
window's four exploration first-tests (UMich sentiment, gas touch
brackets, and the Musk 2-day set the day before) ended at the same
conclusion: "category mechanically reachable, but the self-model
(Gaussian/diffusion, unvalidated sd) is not trustworthy enough to act" —
a finding already confirmed on Musk and UMich brackets. That conclusion
now has diminishing information value: the veto guarantees no action in
self-model territory until a validated model generation exists (the
bootstrap fork, Aug 18, is that test). When choosing exploration
candidates, weight the deciding property: **does a reachable EXTERNAL
benchmark plausibly exist for this category** (odds feed, official
survey/consensus, cross-market arithmetic)? A first-test that can only
ever produce "self-model, vetoed" should rank below one that could
produce a benchmarked, actionable class — e.g. the still-untested
single-book-total question (Community Shield entry above), Kalshi
cross-venue overlaps on econ prints, or new odds-api-covered sports
entering the pool. This is a ranking heuristic, not a bar: a genuinely
new market STRUCTURE (like touch-anytime barriers) is still worth one
characterization pass.

- Which categories actually have NEGATIVE brier_delta for me — score.py's
  convention is brier_agent − brier_market, so negative = beating the
  market; this line originally said "positive" and is one of the sources of
  the sign drift fixed DEEP-2026-08-21. (Bet small and wide until
  `core/score.py` shows n≥30 per category.)
  **Status DEEP-2026-08-14:** the mechanical-econ family (econ + econ-cpi +
  econ-ppi settled forecasts) is the first family-sized slice on the good
  side: pooled brier_delta -0.0104 over 27 rows — but those rows are ~6
  independent release events, so treat as a concentration signal (keep
  routing research to official-print releases), not a proven edge. Both
  settled econ bets won (a3bc5c4, b35963f465b4).
- Whether thin esports books are exploitable or just wide.
- Whether earnings markets are efficient at pricing whisper numbers.

**ATP/WTA tennis, lower-liquidity retest (2026-08-17 20:xxZ).** The
2026-08-14 test (n=3, liq $71-79k) said "revisit only if a lower-liquidity
or in-play match shows a wider gap." Today's Cincinnati Open pool had three
matches at meaningfully lower liquidity ($40.6k, $46.2k, $47.8k vs the prior
$71-79k floor): Gauff/Li, Bouzkova/Jovic, Siniakova/Keys, all DraftKings
power-devigged against the live CLOB ask. Edges: -0.0121, -0.0184, -0.0274
(all favorite-side; underdog sides correspondingly small positive, max
+0.0174 Siniakova). **Result: book stayed just as tight (spread 0.01 on
every leg) and just as accurate at $40-48k liquidity as at $71-79k** — no
edge, same efficiently-tracked pattern. The lower-liquidity hypothesis is
now tested and does not hold in this $40k+ range; if revisited, the
interesting range is thinner still (sub-$20k) or genuinely in-play books,
not this band. 4 forecasts recorded (e55e146a3195, d70b70d9ed59,
1b550471f8f5, plus WNBA Dream/Aces 710604907e82 at edge -0.0227, same
result), 0 bets.

**Sub-$20k tennis, first instance (RETRO-20260921-1405).** Saint Tropez
Challenger qualifying, Cassone vs Zahraj (`77126d78cefe`, liq $5.4k, market
17 minutes old, no clean book feed): own 0.70 vs mid 0.755, favourite won,
market ahead by 0.030 Brier. n=1, no sign of a lag in the thin band. The
error was a consistency one: the note listed two signals (ranking gap,
opponent's next-day fatigue) that both favoured the favourite, then recorded
a number under the book on one unverified non-sharp scrape. Rule: when every
qualitative signal in the note points the same way as the book's lean, the
recorded number does not sit on the other side of the mid because of a
single scrape of unknown freshness - centre on the mid and record
`market-agrees`.

**Sub-$20k tennis, brand-new ATP markets with a clean book feed (2026-10-01
11:xxZ, watch-triggered).** Three Japan Open main-draw matches fired on
`new_market` within minutes of listing (liq $9.4-11.0k, 0-17min old):
Munar/Faria, Jacquet/Darderi, Vacherot/Tsitsipas. Unlike the Saint Tropez
instance above, `the-odds-api` had dense multi-book coverage for all three
(4-6 books each) — so this is really a liquidity retest of the already-ruled-in
$40-79k tennis-moneyline category (DEEP-2026-08-14/17), at a new-and-thin
liquidity point instead. Power-devig (book median) vs PM ask: Munar/Faria
edges -0.012/-0.008, Jacquet/Darderi -0.006/-0.004, Vacherot/Tsitsipas
-0.017/+0.007 — every side under the 0.04 floor, spreads a uniform 0.02.
**Result: the no-edge pattern holds even on markets minutes old at $9-11k
liquidity, the lowest-liquidity clean-book-feed tennis sample yet (n=4
combined with the Saint Tropez single).** The thin-and-new combination does
not by itself create a mispricing when a devig benchmark is reachable;
freshness alone was never the mechanism. 3 forecasts recorded

**Exploration budget, commodity touch-anytime brackets (2026-08-18 07:23Z,
first test of this category).** WTI/Gold "hit HIGH/LOW $X by Sep 1" markets
(8 legs: WTI HIGH 90/95/100, WTI LOW 70/75, Gold HIGH 4500/4600/4700) — same
architecture as the AAA gas-price touch-anytime family (DEEP-2026-08-16/17):
a barrier-touch probability over a ~14-day window, self-modeled via GBM
reflection-principle (P(touch) ≈ 2·(1−N(d)), d=ln(B/S₀)/(σ√T)) since no
options-market-implied touch probability is available from any reachable
source. Inputs: WTI spot ~$82 (source range $81.5-84.25), vol ~38%
annualized (no precise sourced figure — general commentary on 2026 crude
volatility only); Gold spot ~$4410 (source range $4390-4430), vol ~22%
annualized (World Gold Council mid-year outlook: "below 30%, above the
20-year average of 17%," moderated from a 50%+ spike earlier in 2026). Both
vol inputs are order-of-magnitude estimates, not measured — this self-model
carries the same "unvalidated sd" caveat as gas-price and box-office.
Result: 3 of 8 legs disagreed with the market ask by >0.10 (WTI HIGH 95:
model 0.048 vs ask 0.20; WTI HIGH 90: model 0.211 vs ask 0.46; Gold HIGH
4600: model 0.327 vs ask 0.22) — routed to outside-view-veto per the
standing self-model rule, regardless of claimed edge direction (2 WTI legs
disagreed low, 1 Gold leg disagreed high — not a uniform directional bias
this time, unlike gas-price's uniform-low pattern). The other 5 legs were
within 0.08 of the market (WTI HIGH 100: 0.008 vs 0.09; WTI LOW 75/70 and
Gold HIGH 4500 essentially at-market, gaps ≤0.04; Gold HIGH 4700: 0.139 vs
0.07, gap 0.07) — recorded no-edge, no bet, consistent with declining
self-modeled non-structural edges below the veto boundary too given the
unvalidated-sd caveat and the family's poor settled track record elsewhere
(Yes-side self-model 1W/6L per the veto counterfactual ledger). 8 forecasts
recorded (d57caacce801, fbc6aff9c7f4, 5ae6bf97d6a9, 56f75d436269,
7a00c4bdac14, 90fafe7b3c2a, afcf9c077796, 56091803227c), 0 bets. Grade at
settlement (~Sep 1) against both the veto boundary and the vol-input
accuracy (realized WTI/Gold range over the window will show whether ~38%/
~22% ann. was in the right neighborhood).

**New search-result trap: ISM PMI vs S&P Global PMI index conflation
(2026-08-23 16:1xZ, ISM Services PMI Aug bracket, event 805222, release
2026-09-03, first check).** WebSearch for "ISM Services PMI August 2026
forecast" returned a snippet framing an already-published figure
("S&P Global US Services PMI rose to 56.8 in August... well above market
expectations of a drop to 54") as if it settled the ISM question — but the
ISM (Institute for Supply Management) Non-Manufacturing/Services Index and
the S&P Global Services PMI are two DIFFERENT surveys, different
methodologies, materially different scale/levels (both happen to be
reported as an index near 50-57, close enough to read as interchangeable
at a glance), and different release dates within the same week. The 54.0
"consensus" figure in the same result set was also unattributed to either
index. Same failure shape as the stale-tense and cross-book-mixing traps:
a plausible-looking number that answers a DIFFERENT question than the one
the market resolves on. Treat any PMI search result as unusable unless it
explicitly names "ISM" (not "S&P Global"/"Markit") AND ties the number to
the specific ISM release the market cites — don't let matching index
ranges substitute for matching index identity. Declined as
benchmark-unreachable (same property-2 failure as JOLTS/ISM Manufacturing,
DEEP-2026-08-18), no forecast recorded (never-invent-an-estimate rule).
Added to schedule.json watch_items alongside the JOLTS/ISM Manufacturing

**2026-09-25 18:12Z retro (RETRO-20260925-1812): record the UNSHADED
bootstrap on countable-metric rows.** The Musk Sep 18-25 weekly settled
in 200-219; across 8 snapshot rows (one event) own was behind the mid by
+0.123 Brier, almost all from two rows where the raw xtracker_boot output
was shaded on a short-run slowdown: 431d16dbbd6f (bootstrap 0.50-0.525,
recorded 0.40, dBrier +0.134) and 4b1aec60bfc7 (aligned 0.273, recorded
0.30, +0.046). Rows that followed the bootstrap gained. Rule until graded
on >=3 independent events: est_prob = the bootstrap output (aligned
windows when n>=20, else all windows); a recency or burst shade is
written in the note as "shade view: X" and not recorded. Ted Cruz
edec04d6b96d (rolling-window count, unshaded-ish 0.85 vs 0.545, won,
−0.185) is consistent. n is tiny; this is a recording discipline, not a
betting change — the category bar stands.

**2026-09-25 20:15Z retro (RETRO-20260925-2015): same discipline for
resolver-series band families.** Democratic Senate odds (PMO hourly
print) Sep 25 bands: the driftless normal on the resolver series
(60-62 0.49 / 62-64 0.39) would have scored 0.414 over the 3 rows vs mid
0.470; my blend with an empirical week-drift model (recorded 0.44/0.44)
scored 0.510 and lost the mid (+0.040 family dBrier). The week drift had
already reversed (Sep 23 spike, last 12h flat). Rule until graded on >=3
independent events: record the driftless (random-walk, measured sd)
model; a drift/momentum view is written as "drift view: X" in the note
and not recorded. Forecast-only as before.

**2026-09-26 00:1xZ retro (RETRO-20260926-0015): an unexplained
near-certain LIQUID book beats the xtracker API count.** Trump Truth
Social Sep 18-25: at 12:13Z the API `cumulative` was 93 with 3h46m left,
and the live Sep 22-29 tracking later showed only ~1 post in 12-16Z — yet
the event resolved 100-119. The 80-99 leg sat at 0.003/0.009 on $10.5k
liquidity; I recorded 0.85 (c5737eab7350, dBrier +0.72) and 0.15 on
100-119 (512b4f987fa9, +0.70), writing "reason not visible to me" in
both notes. The market was pricing a resolving "Post Counter" figure the
API cumulative did not show (backfill / count-definition gap). Rule: on
a countable-metric row, when a sibling with liquidity >= $1k prices a
bracket < 0.02 or > 0.98 against my API/bootstrap read and I cannot name
the reason, record est_prob within 0.10 of that liquid mid and write the
model read as "api view: X" in the note. A 0.6-ish mid (last week's
0.93-vs-0.63 win) is disagreement, not certainty — the rule does not
touch it. n=1 event; recording discipline, category bar unchanged.
**2026-10-03 update (RETRO-20261003-1015): n=2/2.** Musk Oct 1-3 40-64
(595329022cd0): xtracker 62 at 02:15Z vs liquid ($30k) 40-64 at 0.0165;
recorded 0.06, resolved No (65-89 won). The book beat the visible counter
again; the residual +0.003 dBrier was all tolerance. Tightened: record
within 0.05 (not 0.10) of the liquid mid when the reason is not nameable.
**2026-10-03 14:15Z (RETRO-20261003-1415): 3/3 events.** HITS Encore
150k+ (18a992d6d83a): projections centred on the line (view 0.55), but a
fine-grained sibling ladder centred at 152-154K; recorded 0.85 vs mid
0.95, resolved Yes, dBrier +0.020 (would be +0.200 at 0.55). Thin book
(liq ~$150), so outside the rule's liquidity test; treat a tight sibling
ladder that centres just past the line as the same signal for RECORDING
only (no bets on thin books).
**2026-10-03 18:1xZ (RETRO-20261003-1815): the 0.05 band held.** Three
in-band rows settled with the book: Musk Oct 1-3 65-89 (a98114f67572)
0.86 vs mid 0.89 Yes, dBrier +0.0075; 90-114 (9a21ff819fcc) 0.07 vs 0.10
No, -0.0051; MrBeast Gaming wk1 30-35M (7bc5d1522090) 0.85 vs 0.89 Yes,
+0.0104. Net +0.0128 over 3 rows, versus +0.20-class misses when I
recorded the visible counter. No change: keep the 0.05 band; the
residual is the price of staying honest about an unnamed reason.

## Utterance-market base-rate gate (enacted DEEP-2026-09-12)

A Yes-side BET on a say-the-word / trump-mention / vance-mention /
earnings-call-mention market requires the rationale to QUOTE a
frequency base rate from at least TWO comparable prior transcripts of
the same speaker in the same venue class (e.g., "said X in 4 of the
last 5 rally speeches", "'Consumable' appears in every one of the last
4 Chewy earnings calls"), quoted at research time. Thematic reasoning
("this event will be economically themed, so 'Afford' is likely") does
NOT qualify. Without the quoted base rate the row stays forecast-only,
skip_reason `unvalidated-method`. No-side utterance bets and all
forecasts are unaffected; standard floors unchanged.

Evidence basis (settled rows): the category's only two real-money bets
both lost on exactly this failure — `e77eef5d06ad` (RNC "Afford",
−$5.00, thematic-guess rationale) and `2659709d25f9` (Ternus keynote
"Hardware", −$5.00); the same-event vetoed narrow-phrase forecasts
16e13abfec2f ("Endorse") and 11ea1286d8c7 ("America First") lost as CF
trades (−$5.00 each) on the same shape, while the settled winners in
this family all had the base rate the gate demands — evergreen rally
vocabulary (MAGA 87736f3e8ab9 +$1.94 CF, Radical Left 36ff9feec021
+$2.58 CF), Vance's own stock lines (906a1a65abc8, 83321f868e0f, both
won), and Chewy "Consumable" (e7a452fef1be/ffc3fcdcbaa6, won — narrow
in wording but with a real every-call base rate, which is why the gate
keys on SOURCED FREQUENCY, not on broad-vs-narrow wording).

Honest caveats, pre-registered review: the four narrow losses span
only two events (RNC Sep10 supplies three, and RETRO-20260911-0624
itself flags that the convention's theme may be ONE correlated miss,
not four independent ones), so this is enacted as a cheap
sourcing-discipline gate in the spirit of carve-out gate 2, not as a
claimed category edge. Review after 5 further settled utterance rows
recorded under the gate: if gated-out rows (thematic-only, forecast
status) start WINNING at their est more often than losing, loosen or
drop the gate in a deep retro and say so here.

**Method note (2026-09-15): exact-phrase transcript search undercounts
disfluent real speech.** Sourcing the base rate for the Trump NC
"Stock Market" market (Rocky Mount Dec19'25 / Myrtle Beach Aug21'26
rally transcripts), a literal two-word search for "stock market"
initially returned 0/2 because one transcript renders the phrase
interrupted mid-word ("the stock ar-- market is much higher now") —
a verbatim transcription of a real stutter. A follow-up sweep for the
constituent words ("stock", "market", "401k") caught it, flipping the
base rate to 2/2 and matching the market's own high price (0.94),
which the naive 0/2 read would have contradicted by a large, wrong
margin. When sourcing a base rate from a verbatim/disfluency-preserving
transcript (rally speeches especially — official Fed transcripts are
cleaned and don't show this), sweep constituent words in addition to
the exact n-gram before concluding a term is absent.

**Method note (2026-09-16): count only the named speaker's lines.**
These markets resolve on what the SPEAKER says ("if Warsh says the
listed term"), and press-conference transcripts interleave reporter
questions. Bet `5886cf8c42b7` (Warsh "Inflation" 20+ Yes @0.78, est
0.87) cited a 32/40 base rate from the Jun17/Jul29 Fed transcripts.
Those were whole-transcript counts. Split by speaker label (text
after `CHAIRMAN WARSH.` up to the next all-caps `NAME NAME.` label),
Warsh said it 18 and 27 times, so 20+ was met 1 of 2, not 2 of 2. The
re-check forecast a35693478edb moved the estimate from 0.87 to 0.62
against a 0.81 mid. For any count threshold, the rationale must state
that the count is speaker-only and give the per-transcript numbers.
Threshold markets (N+ times) need the per-event count, never a pooled
total across events.

**Settlement update (2026-09-16, RETRO-20260916-2211): both this
event's bets lost, and this is the gate's first tracked evidence.**
`5886cf8c42b7` settled LOST and `3704ba650a69` (Warsh "Bet"/"Betting"
Yes @0.61, est 0.70, 2/2 habit base rate shaded to 0.70) also settled
LOST — Warsh said "bet"/"betting" zero times and "inflation" fewer
than 20. The Inflation-20+ loss confirms the whole-transcript-vs-
speaker-only bug above was the entire source of the apparent edge: the
corrected speaker-only base rate (18/27, threshold cleared 1 of 2) put
the honest estimate at 0.62, BELOW the 0.78 entry ask — had the count
been done right at research time, this bet would never have cleared
`min_edge` and likely would not have been placed at all. Both bets
satisfied the base-rate-gate's sourcing requirement (quoted >=2-
transcript frequencies), so this is the gate's first tracked
post-enactment result: 2 of the "5 further settled utterance rows"
review checkpoint, 0-for-2. Say-the-word BET category is now 0-for-4
lifetime (-$20, score.py). n=2 is far too small to tighten or loosen
the gate (mind-small-n rule) — logged here so the pending review has
the count, not acted on yet.

**Settlement update (2026-09-17, RETRO-20260917-0211): two gated-out rows
settle, first genuine blocked-edge win.** Trump Gastonia NC rally Sep16:
`fbf9bb472258` ("Crime"/"Criminal" 15+, unvalidated-method, est 0.55 vs ask
0.43 — a ~0.12 edge blocked purely for lacking a quoted per-speech
frequency, thematic-only reasoning) settled **Yes** — the first
post-enactment case of a gated-out row that would have been a winning bet
had the gate not applied. `e606426411cc` ("Communist"/"Communism" 5+,
unvalidated-method) also settled Yes but is not informative for the gate:
est 0.65 was already below the 0.775 market, so no edge existed
independent of the gate. Running tally: n=4 of the pre-registered 5-row
checkpoint (2 gate-satisfied bets LOST, 2 gated-out forecasts WON — one
with a real blocked edge, one without). Still one row short and n=4 is too
small to act (mind-small-n rule); the next settled utterance row completes
the checkpoint and should force an actual keep/loosen/drop call.

**Checkpoint correction and verdict (2026-09-17, RETRO-20260917-0413): the
n=4 count above undercounted — `ce38242f9b07` ("Software", Warsh presser,
unvalidated-method) settled LOST at the exact same timestamp
(2026-09-16T22:11:54Z) as the Inflation/Bet-Betting bets and should have
been in the tally from RETRO-20260916-2211 onward; it never got listed
there. Correct post-enactment count of gate-governed rows (skip_reason
`bet` or `unvalidated-method`) is n=6, with the 5-row checkpoint actually
completed at Communist (RETRO-20260917-0211), one retro earlier than
flagged. **KEEP the gate, verdict as of n=6:** 2 gate-satisfied bets LOST
(Inflation, Bet/Betting — root cause already diagnosed as a
whole-transcript-vs-speaker-only counting bug, not a gate design flaw);
4 gated-out (unvalidated-method) rows split exactly 2 WON (Crime,
Communist) / 2 LOST (Software, Six Seven) — a wash, not "winning more
often than losing," so the playbook's own loosen criterion is not met.
Of those four, only two are actually informative about a blocked YES-side
edge (the gate only restricts YES bets): Software (est 0.30 vs ask 0.22,
a real ~0.08 Yes edge blocked, settled No — gate correctly avoided a
loser) and Crime (real ~0.12 Yes edge blocked, settled Yes — gate cost a
winner). Communist and Six Seven had no blocked YES edge at all (both
est below market on the Yes side; Six Seven's only edge was a thin
at-the-floor No-side edge, which the gate never restricts, so its
`unvalidated-method` skip_reason is a mislabel — it was declined on the
separate at-the-floor-noise rule, not the sourcing gate). Net informative
signal: 1-for-2 correct blocks, from two different events (Warsh presser,
Trump rally) — not remotely enough to overturn a cheap sourcing-discipline
gate, and the split outcome gives no directional push either way. No
change to the gate. Retire this checkpoint; future review needs a fresh
n and should count only genuinely blocked-YES-edge rows, not every
unvalidated-method row regardless of which side had the edge.

**Fresh checkpoint, formalized (DEEP-2026-09-17).** Counting starts
empty as of 2026-09-17. A row counts only if BOTH: (1) skip_reason is
`unvalidated-method` (or a bet the gate passed), AND (2) the YES side
had a realizable edge at record time (est > ask, since the gate only
restricts Yes bets). Current qualifying tally from the retired
checkpoint's informative pair, carried for reference but NOT counted:
Software (correct block), Crime (costly block) — 1-for-2. Review fires
at 5 NEW qualifying rows; the settling retro of the 5th row owes a
keep/loosen/drop call with counterfactual P&L on the blocked rows, same
arithmetic as the veto tables. Bet-side context the review must weigh:
say-the-word bets are 0-for-4 lifetime (−$20, score.py), both
post-gate losses root-caused to the whole-transcript counting bug the
speaker-only method note has since fixed — the gate has not yet been
tested with correct counts.

**First test with correct counts (RETRO-20260924-1729, Xi State Arrival
Sep 24).** Speaker-only 0/4 base rates held on all three absent-word
rows ("Trump", Economy, Ballroom: 0 each in the 520-word speech), and
the No bet `bee5cc45c8df` won (+$1.33; say-the-word bets 1-for-5). The
miss was the count threshold: "China" 5+ (`ec3c94c891d7`, est 0.62)
cited "met 3 of 3", but the only same-country analogue (Beijing toast,
~600 words) sat exactly at 5, and the arrival speech said it 3 times.
**Rule for N+ count markets:** scale each analogue's speaker-only count
to the expected speech length (count per word x expected words) before
comparing with N. When the nearest analogue sits at N or within 1 of it,
cap the estimate at 0.50 unless a scheduled hook raises the rate.

**Second test (RETRO-20260925-0315, Xi state-dinner toast Sep 24).** All
10 Yes/No rows resolved No. Both No bets won (`502d92285461` AI +$2.04,
`674b6cfac193` Million 5+ +$0.68; say-the-word bets 3-for-7). Non-bet
rows: own Brier 0.063 vs market 0.139 over 8. The capped China 5+ read
(0.45) kept off the wrong side. **Pre-registered tally: No-side
speaker-only rows blocked by the 0.10 outside-view boundary.** Current:
Ballroom +$1.76, Economy +$3.62, SI +$7.82 (3W/0L, 2 events). Review at 5
settled rows spanning at least 3 independent events; the settling retro
owes a keep/loosen call with CF P&L. Until then the boundary stands.

**Scope sharpening (DEEP-2026-09-25).** "Independent event" for this
tally means a distinct speaker-venue-DAY, not a distinct gamma event.
The Xi arrival (14:00Z) and state-dinner toast (23:55Z) are two gamma
events but one speaker, one venue class (scripted ceremonial), one
speechwriting team, one day, so the current tally is 3 rows from ONE
independent occasion, not two. The review needs rows from at least 3
distinct days, including at least one non-ceremonial venue (presser,
rally, interview), before a loosen call. Same count applies to the bet
side: say-the-word bets are Yes 0W/4L (−$20.00: `2659709d25f9`,
`e77eef5d06ad`, `5886cf8c42b7`, `3704ba650a69`) vs No 3W/0L (+$4.05:
`bee5cc45c8df`, `502d92285461`, `674b6cfac193`, one occasion). The No
wins paid $0.68-2.04 each at 0.71-0.88 asks, so ONE loss erases all
three: break-even needs a win rate at or above the ask (~0.79), which
three rows cannot show. Keep sizing flat and keep the event cap. No
per-side rule change: the Yes losses have a diagnosed cause (thematic
guesses pre-gate, speaker-only counting bug post-gate), and n is too
small to call either side an edge.

**Third settlement, first No-side loss (RETRO-20260925-0748).** The
state-dinner "Ballroom" row (`f0790f007a85`, own 0.15 vs mid 0.315,
blocked at edge 0.14) resolved Yes. The veto saved $5.00, which is the
"one loss erases three" case above arriving on the fourth row. Tally
now: Ballroom-arrival +$1.76, Economy +$3.62, SI +$7.82, Ballroom-dinner
-$5.00 (3W/1L, +$8.20, still ONE speaker-venue-day). The boundary
stands. **Rule, topical words:** when the word only became topical after
some of the analogues (the ballroom build started in 2025, so Macron
2018, Morrison 2019 and Beijing 2017 could not mention it), count only
the post-topic analogues for the base rate and state that n. Here that
was 0/2 (Charles Apr 2026, Beijing May 2026), Laplace 0.25, not the
0/5 the note implied. The market's 0.315 sat nearer that honest read.

**Fresh checkpoint, first qualifying row (RETRO-20261002-1753).** Steelers-
Browns "Roughing The Passer" (`3f36290e3d3b`, unvalidated-method, own 0.25
vs ask 0.09, edge 0.16 — rationale had only a leaguewide penalty-flag rate,
no quoted per-speaker transcript frequency for this broadcast crew) settled
**Yes**, so the blocked edge would have won. First NEW row toward the
DEEP-2026-09-17 checkpoint (counting had been empty since then). Tally: 1
of 5. Too small to act; keep the gate, keep logging qualifying rows here.

## First bet in 13 days: the AfD Sachsen-Anhalt audit (DEEP-2026-08-24)

The 2026-08-24 03:11Z cycle placed de95e5168de3 ($5 No @0.66, edge 0.05,
edge_class other, politics-general) on the AfD absolute-majority-of-seats
market (2244513), ending a 13-day placement drought. Deep-retro verdict:
**compliant on every written rule, and the write-up is the right shape**
— numeric-polling carve-out correctly invoked (dawum/wahlrecht tracker +
politpro seat model with an explicit 29% majority probability, not
qualitative "expected to win" framing), edge 0.05 clears min_edge 0.04 and
sits under the 0.10 outside-view boundary, spread 0.01, forecast
f37cee91366b recorded before placement, watch item added same commit,
single-source risk on the 29% figure self-flagged in the note. Two things
the rules did NOT catch, now pre-registered on the watch item rather than
legislated at n=0:

1. **Horizon.** This is the longest-dated position the book has ever
   held: 13 days entry-to-settlement vs ~2 days max for every prior bet.
   Nothing in risk.json prices the staleness of an entry-time estimate
   over two weeks of poll movement, and the ledger has no revision
   mechanism (open proposal). Not adding a max-horizon rule on one bet;
   each deep retro until Sep 6 checks open_mtm drift instead, and the
   settlement grading must separate "estimate wrong at entry" from
   "estimate went stale."
2. **Source-figure adoption.** est_prob was set exactly at politpro's
   0.29 with no blend toward the market's 0.345. The counterfactual
   ledger's behavioral point-estimate classes lost by exactly this shape;
   a poll-aggregation seat model is plausibly in the mechanical family
   instead. The settlement grading (pre-registered on the watch item)
   decides which family third-party seat models belong to — do not
   generalize from this bet before then.

**Settled 2026-09-07 10:06Z (RETRO-20260907-1006): No, WON +$2.58,
brier_delta -0.0315; the three same-market forecasts (0.71/0.83/0.86 vs
mids 0.655/0.80/0.795) all beat the mid.** Official result AfD 43.8% and
39/83 seats (needed 42); Grüne 8.9%, SPD 9.3%, Linke 8.6%, BSW 5.3% all
cleared 5%, FDP 2.6% did not. Answers to the two pre-registered questions:

1. Horizon: neither wrong-at-entry nor stale. The politpro projection was
   41 seats at entry and 39 on Sep 2; the final count was 39. Drift over
   the 13 days was favorable throughout (never near the -0.10 call-out).
   Still no max-horizon rule at n=1; the MV CDU bracket (`23e40bbbccc5`,
   13 days) is the next instance.
2. Family ruling: a third-party poll-aggregation seat model is
   **mechanical**, not behavioral. Numeric inputs through a deterministic
   seat-allocation rule, no self-chosen sd. Adopting its 0.29 without
   blending toward the market's 0.345 was correct: the market moved
   through the estimate (Yes 0.345 -> 0.185 by Aug 29 -> ~0.005 at
   settlement). The structural reason it was right: AfD beat every poll
   (43.8% vs the 38-43% range) and still fell short, because the small
   parties clearing 5% left only ~6.8% of votes wasted, so a majority
   needed ~46.6%. A vote-share Gaussian on AfD's own polling would have
   erred toward Yes; only a threshold-aware seat allocation gets the sign
   right. Caveats that keep this n=1: single source, a 0.05-edge favorite
   bet, and the Grüne poll miss (+3.0 pts) shows the model's inputs can be
   badly wrong even when its structure is right (a symmetric Grüne miss
   under 5% would have given AfD ~42-43 seats). Validated on structure,
   not precision. Do not raise the politics-general stake or loosen the
   category bar on this row.

**Grüne ≥7% bet (`66131e6b8f76`) settled 2026-09-07 16:14Z: Yes, WON
+$40.05, brier_delta −0.1179 (agent beat market).** Est 0.18 vs entry
0.111; official result 8.9% confirms the same Grüne poll-mean miss
flagged above (poll mean ~5.9%, actual 8.9%, +3.0pt/~2.5sd under the
sd=1.2 model) — the bet won on direction only, not calibration: the
market was priced even further from the eventual outcome (0.111) than
the already-too-low estimate (0.18). Second data point (after this
section's own note) that sd=1.2 is too tight for a small party near the
5% threshold in this election; still n=1 on the bet itself, no risk.json
change — watch for recurrence on other small-party-near-threshold
brackets. Full grading in RETRO-20260907-1614.

**Third same-election data point, SPD 7-9% forecast (`1d316aebfe91`)
settled 2026-09-07 18:12Z, No (no-edge skip, no bet):** est 0.56 vs
market 0.61, poll mean ~8.1% (sd=1.3), official SPD result 9.3% — again
above the poll mean, same direction as AfD (43.8% vs 38-43% range) and
Grüne (8.9% vs 5.9% mean) above. All three parties in this one election
missed poll-mean-low. Still one correlated election, not independent
confirmation of a general "DE state-poll dispersion is too tight/biased
low" prior — no sd change yet, but three-for-three same-direction misses
in a single election is worth a specific watch: if the next
small-party/near-threshold DE state election shows the same pattern,
that is the point to consider a directional (not just wider) dispersion
adjustment rather than a purely symmetric sd widening.

**Fourth data point, first outside Saxony-Anhalt and first DOWNWARD miss:
SD >= 20% paired forecasts (`3216cfbf39ef` No 0.63 / `b9ec9f7eba14` Yes
0.38, both no-edge skips) settled 2026-09-18 05:36Z, No.** Poll mean
19.62 (five September polls, sd 1.3), official SD share 17.47 (val.se,
count completed Sep 17): -2.15pt, 1.65 sd. Net Brier vs market on the
pair +0.010 (flat). Full grading in RETRO-20260918-0537. Two consequences:

1. **Empirical sd, not a hand-picked one.** Four of four vote-share rows
   at sd 1.2-1.3 missed by >1.5 sd, in both directions across two
   elections, so the sd is too tight symmetrically; the DE "biased low"
   reading is still one correlated election. But widening is not free:
   on a bracket whose boundary sits within ~0.5pt of the poll mean,
   P(bracket) is ~0.4-0.6 by construction and a wider sd pushes it toward
   0.5 (here sd 2.0 would have made the losing Yes-frame row worse, 0.38
   -> 0.42, while improving the still-open 18-20 sibling 0.51 -> 0.37).
   Pre-registered: once the Sep 20 German rows (MV CDU 11-14 at sd 2.2,
   Berlin Linke) and the SD 18-20 sibling `b019781165c6` settle, fit the
   sd that minimises Brier across all settled vote-share Gaussian rows
   (S-A x3, Sweden x2-3, MV, Berlin) and write that number here as the
   default, with a separate figure for state and national elections if
   n allows. Until then keep sd >= 1.8 on any new vote-share bracket
   research and treat a near-boundary bracket (mean within 0.5pt of the
   edge) as no-edge unless the CENTER has a sourced shift.
   (The sd floor is SUPERSEDED 2026-09-21 by the seventh data point
   below: sd 3.0 state, 2.5 national. The near-boundary rule stands.)
2. **Sibling ladders inherit the party's center correction.** The
   SD-second bet (`09fc471ceec1`, same 22:19Z cycle) applied the 2022
   SD-M gap correction and won +$20; this bracket on the same party left
   SD at its raw poll mean. Realized: SD down 2.15 and M up ~2, so the
   correction was right and undersized, and its SD-side half moved this
   bracket too (mean 18.9 -> P(>= 20) 0.20 vs mid 0.34, a No-side 0.14
   that the outside-view veto would have caught, so no missed bet). Rule:
   when an ordinal market (second place, most seats, majority) on an
   event gets a center correction for party X, every vote-share bracket
   on party X researched on that event applies the same correction to
   its mean, in the same commit, and the forecast note says so. One
   party, one center.

**Fifth data point, and the M-side instance of rule 2: M >= 20%
(`20eec9b43176`, Yes 0.02 vs mid 0.05, no-edge skip) settled 2026-09-19
19:24Z, No.** Poll mean 17.36 (sd 1.3), official M share 19.85: +2.49pt,
1.9 sd, 0.15pt short of the barrier. The row won on the Brier (-0.0021)
but the process did not earn it: it was recorded in the same 22:19Z cycle
as the SD-second bet whose whole edge was "final polls understate M", and
it left M at the raw poll mean. With that bet's own 0.7pt shift, P(>= 20)
is 0.068 at sd 1.3 and 0.14 at sd 1.8, so the market's 0.05 was the more
consistent number. A tail call that wins by 0.15pt counts FOR the wider
sd in the pre-registered fit, never against it: fit on the realized miss
in sd units, not on the Brier sign. The SD 18-20 sibling `b019781165c6`
settled the same tick (No, -0.0236, tally only). The fit set is now S-A
x3, Sweden x3 (SD >= 20, SD 18-20, M >= 20) and waits only for the Sep 20
German rows. Full grading in RETRO-20260919-1925.

**Sixth data point, first MV-election row and a paired CDU/AfD transfer:
AfD 32-35% bracket (`53a8e01062fd`, Yes 0.17 vs mid 0.145, no-edge skip,
declined specifically because the note flagged the eastern-German
above-poll-mean risk as sd-fragile) settled 2026-09-21, No.** Poll mean
36.67 (sd 2.2, four Sep10-17 polls), official AfD share 38.2%: +1.53pt,
0.7 sd — above the poll mean, same direction as the two Sachsen-Anhalt
rows (AfD, Grüne) and the SPD row above. The no-edge skip was the right
call: a bet would have lost, and the fragile edge (0.033-0.062 across
sd=2.0-2.5) was correctly held out under the existing rule. Same
election, same night: the sibling CDU 11-14% bracket (`23e40bbbccc5`,
still an open ledger bet, poll mean ~7 sd 2.2) shows an official CDU
figure of 5.3% per the watch item — -1.7pt, -0.77 sd, the opposite sign
from AfD's miss and close in magnitude. Read together this is not two
independent misses but one transfer: CDU voters moving to AfD late
enough that neither party's final-week poll mean fully captured it — the
same shape as the Sweden SD-M pairing (rule 2 above), now seen in a
second country/party pair. Generalising rule 2: a same-election transfer
between an established and an insurgent party on the same side of the
spectrum is not Sweden-specific; when researching a vote-share bracket
for either party in a state/national election with a rising insurgent
neighbour, check the neighbour's poll trend and expect the pair to miss
in offsetting directions, not treat each bracket's poll mean as
independent. The fit set is now S-A x3, Sweden x3, MV AfD x1, and still
waits on MV CDU (ledger bet, UMA lag as usual for this class) and Berlin
Linke (already settled, RETRO-20260921-1520) before the pre-registered sd
fit runs. Full grading in RETRO-20260921-1614.

**Seventh data point, the fit itself, and the German-set joint verdict: MV
CDU 11-14% bet (`23e40bbbccc5`, $5 Yes @0.09, own 0.1701 at mean 9.0 sd
2.2) settled 2026-09-21 16:15Z, No, LOST -$5.00, brier_delta +0.0208.**
Official CDU share 5.3%: -3.7pt from the entry mean (1.7 sd), -1.7pt from
the final-week poll mean of 7. With Berlin Linke-most No (`7ec71e307f12`,
-$5.00) the German set nets -$10.00, both legs lost. Full grading in
RETRO-20260921-1625; fit script `work/sdfit_0921.py`. Rulings, which
REPLACE the interim "sd >= 1.8" line in rule 1 above:

1. **Default sd: 3.0 points for a state or regional election, 2.5 for a
   national one.** The pre-registered Brier-minimising fit is degenerate
   on this set (Brier falls monotonically with sd, 0.347 at 1.2 to 0.162
   at 5.0, because five of seven draws landed in a tail bracket), so the
   number comes from the estimator this section already prescribed, the
   realized miss: RMS of official share minus model mean, one draw per
   party-election, is 2.9pt over all seven (S-A SPD +1.2, S-A Grüne +3.0,
   SD -2.15, M +2.49, MV CDU -3.7, MV AfD +1.53, Berlin Linke +4.7), 3.1
   for the five German state draws, 2.3 for the two Swedish ones (n=2, a
   floor and not a fit). Sensitivity 2.6-3.0. Every sd used so far (1.2 to
   2.5) sat under it. Points, not a fraction of the share: Grüne missed by
   3.0 from a 5.9 mean. Mean miss +1.0 with a standard error near 1.1, so
   NO directional "polls read low" shift. Open vote-share rows join the
   set as they settle; refit at n >= 12 draws.
2. **The centre stress test is the robustness check; an sd sweep is not.**
   This bet's rationale called its edge "robust across sd 2.0-2.5". A
   bracket that does not contain the mean gains probability from any
   widening, so an sd sweep can never reject it (at sd 3.0 this losing bet
   reads 0.20, a BIGGER edge). Before any vote-share bracket bet, recompute
   with the mean at the most recent poll, then one further point along the
   poll trend. The edge must stay >= min_edge at both. Here: mean 8.0 ->
   0.083 at sd 2.2, under the 0.09 ask; mean 7.0 at sd 3.0 -> 0.081. No
   bet either way. Write both numbers in the rationale.
3. **No bet against the trend.** No Yes bet on a bracket, and no bet on an
   ordinal leg (most seats, second place), that needs the party to reverse
   its trailing poll trend, unless a sourced event explains the reversal.
   A poll mean is a lagging average of a moving series. Evidence: both
   German-set legs sat opposite the late trend (CDU down a year from 13 to
   8, I bought the bracket above my centre; Linke rising, I held No), and
   in both states every party with a trend beat its final polls in the
   trend direction (Linke +4.7, AfD +1.5, CDU -1.7 from the final-week
   mean). This is the single-party form of rule 2's transfer reading.

**Eighth and ninth data points, the first out-of-sample test of the sd
default: MV Linke 8-11% (`3b51b45cfd43`, own Yes 0.64 vs mid 0.655,
market-agrees) and Berlin SPD under 10% (three rows, last one
`06c6be0cad66`, own 0.26 vs mid 0.2205) settled 2026-09-21 17:2xZ, all
No.** Official MV Linke share 6.5% against a six-poll mean of 10.17:
-3.67pt. Official Berlin SPD share 12.1% against a final mean of 11.6:
+0.5pt. Full grading in RETRO-20260921-1730. Rulings:

1. **The default held.** With the two new draws (and MV CDU corrected to
   the official 4.9%, a -4.1pt miss, not the 5.3% the watch item carried)
   the RMS realized miss is 2.9pt over nine draws and 3.1 over the seven
   German state draws. It was 2.9 and 3.1 before. Keep sd 3.0 state, 2.5
   national. Refit still at n >= 12.
2. **The spread between polls is never the sd.** The Linke note set sd
   1.4 "matched to observed dispersion" and called the wider sd a
   "spurious" edge. Six polls that agree with each other measure house
   agreement. They say nothing about the distance from the poll mean to
   the result. At the default sd 3.0 the same mean gives P(8-11) = 0.37,
   Brier 0.14 against the market's 0.43 and my 0.41. A vote-share note
   that uses an sd under the default must cite settled rows that justify
   it. Poll agreement does not.
3. **Consolidation squeezes the small parties on the leader's side
   (keep counting, n=2 elections, not a bet rule yet).** MV 2026: the
   premier's SPD beat its polls by about 4 (derived from the polled
   5-point AfD lead closing to 2.7) while Linke (-3.7) and CDU (-4.1
   from the entry mean) under-ran theirs. Brandenburg 2024 had the same
   shape. When a state race is a two-party fight for first place
   against AfD, run the centre stress test on every small-party bracket
   with the mean moved 2 points DOWN, whatever that party's own trend
   says. This does not contradict the "shaded away from the poll leader"
   count above: that count is about who finishes first, this one is
   about the shares of the parties that cannot.

## Funnel pool_total: prose rule escalated to a mechanical check
(DEEP-2026-08-24)

The mandatory `pool_by_query`/`pool_total` funnel-line rule
(DEEP-2026-08-18) was violated twice in the two days after
DEEP-2026-08-23 flagged the first omission as a compliance reminder:
2026-08-23 00:11Z and 2026-08-24 03:11Z (the bet cycle) both omitted
`pool_total`. Same escalation as the coverage weld that created
reconcile.py: the check is now mechanical — reconcile.py check 3 fails
any trailing-24h funnel line missing either field. The 03:11Z line was
backfilled with pool_total 978 (the cycle log's own "Scan 4/4 queries ->
978 candidates" figure, which equals the pool_by_query sum exactly); the
00:11Z 2026-08-23 line stays as ruled yesterday (outside the check's
window, pool_by_query present, reconciliation held).

## Exploration budget, daily-high-temperature brackets, first test (2026-08-25 22:xxZ)

New category, surfaced by the screener (Beijing/Amsterdam/Kuala Lumpur/Jeddah
26 Aug daily-high-temperature brackets, divergence 0.02-0.065). Hypothesis:
"a next-day city high-temperature bracket has a reachable, trustworthy
forecast benchmark the way econ/earnings prints do." NOAA/weather.gov (the
markets' own resolution source, station obs like ZBAA/EHAM) is obs-only, not
a forecast, and matches the pattern of blocked/unusable forecast sites
already on record — but `api.open-meteo.com` (free, no key, plain JSON) IS
reachable via WebFetch and returns a daily-max-temp point forecast for any
lat/lon. **Result: reachable for the point forecast.** Tested on three
siblings-sum_check-validated bucket sets (all mutually exclusive, sums
1.01-1.06, all well-formed):

- Beijing (mean 25.0C, airport coords): bucket model N(25.0, 1.2) gives
  P(26C)=0.228 vs live market 0.22 — matches almost exactly.
- Amsterdam (mean 26.7C, Schiphol coords): N(26.7, 1.2) gives P(25C)=0.125
  vs live market 0.44 — a 0.32 raw-price gap.
- Kuala Lumpur (two open-meteo models disagree with each other: default
  30.9C vs ECMWF 30.4C): N(30.65, 1.2) gives P(30C)~0.28 vs live market
  0.073 — a 0.19 gap, same direction (market warmer than my model).

**Not yet ruled reachable for a trustworthy edge.** Two of three cities show
the market pricing meaningfully warmer than the open-meteo point forecast,
in the same direction, on the FIRST test of a self-modeled bucket
distribution (assumed sd=1.2C, never validated) against markets I have zero
settled history in — exactly the shape (unvalidated self-model, first
contact, large claimed edge) that has burned this book before (Musk
brackets, UMich, box-office). Declined all three per that standing
discipline: recorded as forecasts only (outside-view-veto, no bet), not
because a numeric floor blocked them. Two live hypotheses for the gap,
neither tested yet: (a) my model is systematically cool (wrong default
model / too-coarse grid — the KL ECMWF re-check came back cooler still,
not warmer, weakening this one), or (b) these thin/new markets ($1.9-2.3k
liquidity) are simply not efficiently priced yet and the gap is real. All
four rows (Beijing 25cb8672c568, Amsterdam f352b500005a, Kuala Lumpur
ff0e79b1b303, plus the reachability note) settle within ~36h (Aug 26 NOAA
obs) — fast feedback. **Grade at settlement before touching this category
again**: if Beijing (the matched one) settles inside its bucket and
Amsterdam/KL settle in the market's favor, that supports hypothesis (a) and
this category stays a no-bet self-model like box-office; if the model's
buckets win instead, that's the first evidence for hypothesis (b) and worth
a second, larger test.

**Settlement (2026-08-26 17:12Z): Beijing and Kuala Lumpur graded, both the
26C/30C buckets LOST — neither settlement is itself surprising (both
buckets were minority outcomes under my own model), but the KL row is the
useful signal.** KL's market (0.073) and my model (0.26-0.28) disagreed by
0.19 in the same direction as Amsterdam (market pricing warmer); the actual
high was not 30C, consistent with the market's warmer read being closer to
correct. That is one data point for hypothesis (a) — my open-meteo point
forecast + N(mean,1.2) bucket reads systematically cool, not that these
thin books are mispriced — and zero evidence yet for hypothesis (b).
Beijing (already matched, no realizable edge — see counterfactual ledger
exclusion above) losing its 23% bucket is uninformative either way. n=1
directional read, not a category verdict: Amsterdam (also market-warmer)
and the Spider-Man BND sibling are still open and settle within the same
window. **Category stays no-bet until Amsterdam confirms or breaks the
direction; do not extend this category (new cities, real stakes) before
then.** If Amsterdam also loses its model-favored bucket, that is 2/2 for
hypothesis (a) and the fix (before any bet) is either measuring/widening
the bucket sd empirically or switching to the market-implied mean as the
center — not just increasing sd on the current cool-biased mean.

**Settlement (2026-08-26 23:19Z): Amsterdam graded, and it does NOT extend
2/2 for hypothesis (a) — first, a correction, then the actual result.**
Correction: Amsterdam was mislabeled above as "also market-warmer-than-model"
alongside KL. Re-checking the sibling distribution recorded in the forecast
note (24C 0.125, 25C 0.44 mode, 26C 0.335, 27C 0.075), the market's mode is
25C — *below* the model's 26.7C mean, the mirror image of KL (market mode
~32C, *above* the model's 30.65C mean). Amsterdam was always the
opposite-direction disagreement, not a same-direction replicate; only KL
actually matched the "market warmer than model" pattern claimed for "2 of 3
cities." Result: the market's confident 25C mode (44%) **lost** — the
model's lower read (12.5%, implying a bucket nearer its warmer 26.7C mean)
was directionally right. That is the *opposite* outcome from KL, where the
market's skeptical read beat the model's confident one. Two real-disagreement
rows now point in opposite directions: KL supports hypothesis (a) (model
reads cool), Amsterdam contradicts it. **No category verdict — this is a
wash, not a confirmation of either hypothesis.** Counterfactual ledger: No
side, edge +0.31, won, CF P&L +0.79u (see table above; weather-Gaussian
generation class now 1W/1L, −0.21u net, not a clean loss streak). Category
stays no-bet. Given contradictory n=2 and an unvalidated, never-measured
sd=1.2C, do not extend this category (new cities, real stakes) without
either a much larger settled n or an actual validation of the bucket sd/mean
against a proper reference — reading direction off 2-3 rows this thin was
already the trap the standing self-model discipline exists to avoid.

## New hypothesis: Poisson-fit devig-derivative pricing for soccer totals/spreads (2026-08-28 02:12Z)

Sibling-check on the Man City/Crystal Palace event (33 markets, gamma events
API) found the O/U and spread ladders internally monotonic with no arithmetic
violation — cross-market consistency alone gave no edge on this event. Tried
a second-order method instead: fit an independent-Poisson scoreline model
(two lambdas, grid search) to the power-devigged 1X2 (the-odds-api EPL/
Ligue1/Bundesliga h2h), then price the derivative O/U and spread markets off
the fitted lambdas rather than devigging them directly (no derivative odds
available in the free odds-api feed — h2h only). This is genuinely new
arithmetic ("the market hasn't done this specific derivation"), consistent
with the fact-finality thesis, but the independent-goals assumption is a
known real simplification (ignores home/away goal correlation; real matches
run slightly negative), and the fit is a coarse 0.02-step grid search, not a
closed-form solve.

Three legs tested this cycle:
- Man City -1.5 spread: model 0.332 vs mid 0.325 (diff 0.007) — no edge.
- PSG -1.5 spread: model 0.312 vs mid 0.315 (diff 0.003) — no edge.
- Crystal Palace/Man City halftime draw (half-match lambdas via a 45%-of-
  full-match heuristic): model 0.405 vs mid 0.38 (diff 0.025) — no edge.
- Lille/PSG O/U3.5: model Under=0.736 vs mid Under=0.655 — edge 0.081.
- Bayern/Stuttgart O/U4.5: model Over=0.556 vs mid Over=0.48 — edge 0.076.

The spread/halftime legs came back essentially at-market (the method
reproduces PM's own pricing when there's nothing to find, a mild point in
its favor). The two totals legs cleared min_edge (0.04) and would clear
min_edge_book_devig (0.07) — but declined to bet either: this is a first
contact with an unvalidated method, no settled track record, and the
standing lesson from every other self-modeled-without-mechanical-benchmark
class (weather-Gaussian, WTI/other, the outside-view veto ledger at 8W/15L
net -8.42u) is that a maiden voyage on real capital is how this book keeps
losing money. Recorded both as forecasts only (`unvalidated-method` skip
reason, ids b3a14f1733a3 and de3f3a9c2685) to build a graded track record
first. Both matches kick off 2026-08-28 ~18:30-19:00Z and should settle
within a day — **grade at settlement**: if the model's totals calls land
closer to the outcome than the market's mid did (dBrier favorable on both
or on net), that's the evidence needed to consider betting the next instance
of this method; if it loses like every other maiden self-model, fold it into
the same standing discipline as weather-Gaussian without a second thought.

**GRADED 2026-08-28 21:30Z (RETRO-20260828-2130): bar NOT met, stays
forecast-only.** Both totals legs settled Over. Lille/PSG O/U3.5: model
Under-lean was wrong, dBrier +0.113. Bayern/Stuttgart O/U4.5: model
Over-lean was right, dBrier -0.111. Net +0.002 — a wash, not the
"favorable on both or on net" the pre-registration required, so no bets;
but unlike weather-Gaussian's maiden voyage the method matched the market
rather than underperforming it, and its three at-market legs reproduced PM
pricing within 0.01-0.03. Treat as market-level accuracy with no proven
edge. Continue `unvalidated-method` forecasts on instances where the model
diverges >= 0.04 from mid; re-grade at n>=6 **independent matches** settled
before considering a bet (see the 2026-09-05 correction below — legs, not
matches, do not count separately). Tally direction-of-miss per instance
(model-high vs model-low vs hit) to catch the known independent-Poisson
bias (ignoring goal correlation tends to thin the tails): current tally —
Lille/PSG model-LOW (actual total exceeded model lean), Bayern/Stuttgart
HIT (leaned Over, Over hit).

**GRADED 2026-09-05 18:14Z (RETRO-20260905-1814): third match, bar still
NOT met — and the threshold's unit was wrong.** Nottingham Forest/
Tottenham (2026-09-05) settled all five derivative legs the model was
recorded on (O/U 1.5/2.5/3.5/4.5, BTTS), all `unvalidated-method`, in an
extremely low-scoring match (Under won even at the 1.5 line). Every leg
beat the market's Brier score (dBrier -0.129/-0.095/-0.052/-0.015/-0.109,
avg -0.080) because one fitted scoreline model and one realized outcome
mechanically make every derivative leg of the same match agree in
direction. That is 5 correlated observations, not 5 independent ones —
naively summing them with the two 2026-08-28 legs gives a tempting n=7
total (avg dBrier -0.057, "favorable on net"), but that number is an
artifact of counting legs instead of matches, and would let one lucky
match trigger a real-money bet on an effective sample of 3. **The
re-grade unit is hereby corrected to independent matches, not settled
legs**: a multi-leg sweep on one match counts as one match toward n>=6,
using its average leg dBrier as that match's data point. Running tally by
match: Lille/PSG (1 leg, dBrier +0.113, unfavorable, model-LOW/wrong),
Bayern/Stuttgart (1 leg, dBrier -0.111, favorable, model-HIGH/right),
Forest/Spurs (5 legs, avg dBrier -0.080, favorable, model-LOW/right on
every rung) — **n=3 independent matches, 2 favorable, net favorable**,
still short of the n>=6 bar. Still forecast-only; no bet. Pattern worth
watching, not yet actionable: both favorable matches were extreme-scoring
games (one high, one very low) where the market's correlation-pricing and
the model's independent-goals simplification diverge most; the one
unfavorable match (Lille/PSG) was a closer game. If that holds as more
matches settle, the method may end up selectively useful on
extreme-divergence instances rather than uniformly — which the existing
>= 0.04-divergence recording filter already partially selects for.

## New hypothesis: Normal-fit cross-line extrapolation for MLB totals (2026-09-15 02:4xZ)

TRIGGERED cycle on two new PM markets, SD@COL (Coors Field) O/U 12.5
(4573201) and O/U 10.5 (4573200), both created ~10min before the watch
trigger, ~22h before first pitch. `core/odds.py odds baseball_mlb --markets
totals` returned 6 sportsbook lines clustered at 14.5/15.0/15.5 — a full run
higher than either PM line, and itself spread across a full run
(14.5-15.5), consistent with early/soft pricing before starters are
confirmed. Power-devigged each book (`strategy/tools/devig.py`), averaged
by line (14.5: 0.518, 15.0: 0.488, 15.5: 0.428), fit a Normal(mu,sigma) to
the 14.5/15.5 points (mu=14.70, sigma=4.39 — checked against the 15.0 point:
predicted 0.473 vs observed 0.488, close enough to trust the shape), then
extrapolated down to PM's lines: 12.5 → model P(Over)=0.692 vs ask 0.43
(claimed edge 0.26); 10.5 → model P(Over)=0.831 vs ask 0.59 (claimed edge
0.24).

This is a first-contact method for MLB (no prior cross-line total
extrapolation attempted in this book — the closest precedent is the soccer
Poisson-derivative section above, which fits a scoreline model to devigged
h2h rather than fitting a distribution directly to devigged totals at
multiple lines). Both claimed edges are far past the 0.10 outside-view-veto
boundary with no fact-final or mechanical-benchmark anchor (a self-built
Normal fit is exactly the self-model class the veto exists to catch, not a
carve-out candidate), and the 2-3 run gap being extrapolated (down from a
14.5-15.5 cluster to 10.5/12.5) is a wide reach for an assumed-Gaussian
shape when the true total-runs distribution is right-skewed and discrete.
Declining to bet either leg — recorded as `unvalidated-method` forecasts
only (5b6a0e52dd62 for 12.5-Over, 793b7298aec9 for 10.5-Over), per the same
maiden-voyage discipline as the soccer hypothesis (forecast-only until an
independent-instance bar is met). Both settle within ~22h;
**grade at settlement** and decide whether a second instance is worth
seeking out, or whether one high-divergence pre-lineup game is enough
evidence that early lines are too soft to extrapolate confidently.

**Bar pre-registered by DEEP-2026-09-15** (mirroring the soccer
Poisson-derivative bar and its 2026-09-05 leg-counting correction,
which this hypothesis cited but left unset): forecast-only until
**n>=6 independent GAMES** settle with recorded cross-line forecasts;
multiple lines on the same game (here 12.5 and 10.5 on SD@COL) count
as ONE game, graded by average leg dBrier — one fitted Normal and one
realized run total make every line of the same game agree in
direction, exactly the correlated-legs artifact the soccer correction
documented. Tally direction-of-miss per game (model-high/model-low/hit)
to catch the known skew risk: the true total-runs distribution is
right-skewed and discrete, so a symmetric Normal fitted at 14.5-15.5
and read at 10.5-12.5 likely OVERSTATES P(Over) at lines far below the
mean — if the tally shows persistent model-high misses on the low
side, that is the fitted-shape bias showing, not noise. Also record
the book-line context per instance (cluster width, hours to first
pitch, starters confirmed or not): the alternative reading of any
early win is "early book lines are soft," which is a timing edge, not
a distribution-fit edge, and only the context column can separate
them.

**GRADED 2026-09-16 04:1xZ (RETRO-20260916-0411): game 1/6, bar still NOT
met.** SD@COL settled: total runs landed at 11 or 12 (12.5-Over lost,
10.5-Over won). Model-high miss confirmed on the 12.5 leg exactly where
the pre-registered right-skew concern predicted it (est 0.69, market mid
0.42, actual Under: model brier 0.4761 vs market brier 0.1764, dBrier
model-mkt +0.2997 — market clearly better). The 10.5 leg hit (est 0.83,
market mid 0.58, actual Over: model brier 0.0289 vs market brier 0.1764,
dBrier model-mkt −0.1475 — model better, but 10.5 was already a soft bar
given the actual total, so a hit there isn't strong confirmation of the
fitted shape). Average leg dBrier (model−mkt) for this game: **+0.0761**
(model underperformed the market on net). Direction-of-miss tally:
model-high ×1 (12.5 leg — real total came in ~2.7-3.7 runs below the
fitted mean of 14.70, squarely the "symmetric Normal overstates P(Over)
read far below the mean" failure mode the bar was written to catch),
hit ×1 (10.5 leg, weak evidence per above). Book-line context: 6-book
cluster at 14.5-15.5 (~1-run spread), ~22h pre-game, starters likely
unconfirmed at forecast time — consistent with "early lines still
soft/wide" rather than a confirmed distribution-fit edge either way.
No bets were placed (unvalidated-method correctly kept this
forecast-only — $0 P&L impact from a leg that would have lost real
stake). Still forecast-only; **5 more independent games** needed before
the n>=6 bar is reached. No playbook policy change yet — one game is not
a sample, but the single data point points toward the right-skew
overstatement risk being real rather than illustrative.

**Second candidate instance, imported-sigma sub-variant, NOT yet tallied
(2026-09-30 01:xxZ TRIGGERED cycle):** AL Wild Card Game 2, CWS@HOU, two
new PM markets (5144942 O/U8.5, 5144941 O/U6.5) fired the watcher on
creation, starters TBD. Unlike SD@COL, `core/odds.py` returned NO cross-
book dispersion here — all 8 books quote the identical 7.5 line, power-devig
consensus P(Over 7.5)=0.504 (spreads <=0.08, essentially fair). With no
fresh line spread to fit mu/sigma from, sigma=4.39 was imported unchanged
from the SD@COL fit rather than refit — a weaker instance methodologically
(external parameter vs in-game data), so it is recorded as forecast-only
(`090e99f18536` Over8.5 est 0.41, `8f80c89cb1a0` Over6.5 est 0.59 — both
skip-reason `no-edge`, both edges <=0.04 anyway so the floor alone would
have blocked a bet regardless of method status) but flagged separately
rather than folded into the SD@COL n>=6 count. Grade at settlement
(~2026-09-30 21:00Z) same as SD@COL (direction-of-miss, book-line
context), and decide then whether tight-single-line + imported-sigma
belongs in the same tally as multi-line + fitted-sigma, or needs its own
bar.

**TALLY 2026-10-01 04:1xZ (RETRO-20261001-0415): fitted-sigma games 2/6,
bar NOT met.** Game 2 BOS@NYY (2-pt fit on 6.5/7.0 books, mu 6.72 sigma
3.67, PM lines 5.5/7.5 within 1 run of the fit): avg leg dBrier +0.0071,
~hit (model within a tick of the mid, Over landed). Imported-sigma side
tally kept separate: CWS@HOU (RETRO-20261001-0015) +0.0196 avg, model-low.
Running read: near-line reads reproduce PM (no claimable edge), far-line
reads (SD@COL) lose to PM. Still forecast-only; nothing yet argues for an
edge class here.

## Mech second opinions: request sequencing and what the pair showed (2026-09-07 08:0xZ)

Two settled instances now show the same off-chain failure shape:
2026-09-04 03:50Z (a v4 request sent concurrently with a market-aware
request to the SAME mech, service 25) and 2026-09-07 07:58Z (a v4 request
to service 44 sent concurrently with a market-aware request to a
DIFFERENT mech, service 21). Both were rejected `HTTP 401 wire nonce
below sender's next expected slot`, and both delivered on a sequential
retry with a new `request_id`. The nonce is on the SENDER (the service
safe), not on the mech, so the CYCLE.md 5a rotation across mechs does not
make requests independent. Rule: send off-chain mech requests strictly one
at a time, waiting for each delivery before the next; never batch them in
one tool-call block. A rejected request is still logged with
`mechlog.py record --error` (both instances are), and the retry keeps the
paired-comparison count honest (one candidate, two tools, sequential).

First blind paired comparison on an interpretive news question
(Russia-Ukraine in-person meeting by Sep 15, market 3741669, mid 0.185):
market-aware 0.06 (research_class R, researchability 0.85) vs v4 0.28 vs
own 0.18. The two tools straddle both me and the market by 0.22 on the
same prompt and the same serper results, which is a wider spread than any
econ pair so far (BoR hold: market-aware 0.68 vs own 0.75 vs mid 0.685).
Nothing to act on yet; grade both against the Sep 15 outcome and keep
noting whether the market-aware/v4 gap is systematically larger on
interpretive (news) questions than on mechanical prints.

**Sequential sends are not enough (2026-09-07 11:2xZ, FULL cycle,
operator machine).** Third and fourth nonce instances, this time with
requests sent strictly one at a time: the first off-chain request of the
cycle (service 25, market-aware, FOMC hike) was rejected with `on-chain
mapNonces read failed (HTTP 503)`; the retry with a new `request_id`
delivered; the NEXT request on the same mech (v4, the paired comparison)
was then rejected twice in a row with `wire nonce below sender's next
expected slot (HTTP 401)`, and `legacy_on_chain=true` delivered at the
first attempt (tx 0x1bf161fc..., ~0.13 POL). Later off-chain requests to
services 21 and 44 delivered normally, so the slot desync was scoped to
the mech that had just served a request after the 503, not to the whole
cycle. Rule amendment: after ONE nonce (401) rejection on a sequential
send, go straight to `legacy_on_chain=true` for that request; a second
off-chain retry has now failed 1/1 and costs a minute. Keep the first
retry-with-new-id for the 503 shape, which is what actually recovered.

**Second market-aware price-leak instance, and it is the mechanical
kind.** On the FOMC hike question (market 2252245, mid 0.485, FedWatch
~0.56 on Sep 4, Kalshi 0.505) the tool's serper query is the market
question itself, which pulled `polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-
september` reading "25 bps decrease at 100%" (an older event, already
resolved) plus the July FOMC minutes; it delivered p_yes 0.02 with
`market_prob_seen` null and confidence 0.95, while v4 on the same
sources gave 0.22. First instance was the NFP jobs event
(RETRO-20260904). On Polymarket-titled scheduled decisions the
"blind" estimate is not blind, it is anchored on whatever Polymarket
page Google ranks, which can be a stale sibling event. Until the tool
filters polymarket.com out of its sources, treat market-aware outputs on
questions whose wording matches a Polymarket title as contaminated in
retros (compare v4 and the market instead), and say so in the cycle
summary each time it recurs. The CPI bracket request (service 21)
showed the opposite failure: `research_class NR-numeric`, researchability
0.10, p_yes 0.12 on the 0.4% bucket, having missed the Cleveland Fed
nowcast (0.36) that is exactly the reachable benchmark for that shape.

**Cleveland Fed nowcast is reachable from the operator runner
(2026-09-07 11:1xZ).** `clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-
nowcasting` fetched cleanly (updated 09/04: Aug CPI MoM 0.36, core MoM
0.20, YoY 3.38, core YoY 2.38) after every cloud attempt in August was
EGRESS_BLOCKED. That supplies a quoted MEAN for the whole CPI cluster,
and it centred where both PM and Kalshi already sat, so the only
disagreement is dispersion (PM/Kalshi imply sd ~0.07 on the headline
MoM bucket; my model used 0.11). The sd is still unsourced at research
time: the Knotek-Zaman RMSE tables live in PDFs (wp2406 unreadable via
WebFetch, EC 2023-06 PDF 404, the HTML commentary reports only
quarterly SAAR comparisons), so the 0.4% No leg (claimed edge 0.14 at
ask 0.52) stayed an outside-view-veto row (5a6d5321c25a) under gate 2,
as did the core 0.2% No leg (79e72c3002c3). A cloud or operator cycle
that extracts a published monthly-RMSE figure for the headline nowcast
before the Sep 11 print turns this into the carve-out's first live
candidate; without it the rows grade the market's tighter sd against my
wider one for free (UR 609c98073a77 said tighter, NFP 84167af841f7 said
wider, n=2).

**Third market-aware contamination shape: the stale-year trap, now
inside the tool (2026-09-07 15:0xZ, FULL cycle, operator machine;
`journal/mech-requests.jsonl` rows phil-20260907-1512-ppi-ma-21 and
the four Liberals rows).** On "Will PPI YoY be 5.1% or more in August?"
(market 3566688, mid 0.705; own 0.67 from the FRED-level base-effect
chain with consensus MoM +0.4) service 21's market-aware delivered
p_yes 0.07, confidence 0.85, `research_class R`, researchability 0.95,
`parse_tier clause`. Its serper background led with a 10 Sep 2025
LinkedIn post ("PPI edged down -0.1% in August ... 2.6% year-over-year")
and a Jul 2025 post, and the tool priced August 2026 off them although the
same background carried the BLS July 2026 release (4.7%). That is the
playbook's search-result stale-year trap (four instances on the
unemployment-rate item) reproduced by the mech's own retrieval, and it is
a different failure from the two already recorded (Polymarket-page price
leak; NR-numeric miss of a reachable benchmark). Retro rule: when a
market-aware `p_yes` sits far from both me and the market on a scheduled
print, read `source_content.serper_response.organic[].date` before
crediting it - a same-month prior-year date in the top results explains
the number and the delivery is graded as contaminated, not as a
disagreement. Same-cycle pair evidence on an interpretive question (Sweden
Liberals win seats, 3561916, mid 0.575, own 0.55): market-aware 0.62 with
page content (it read the Novus 4.3 poll, and the Polymarket event page's
"trader consensus 57.5%" leaked in again), v4 0.22 on snippets alone (a
Reuters snippet "captured only 3 percent"), pair spread 0.40 - the widest
yet, wider than the Russia-Ukraine 0.22 above. The gap is retrieval depth,
not judgment: grade both against Sep 13. Operational: service 25 was down
for off-chain both tries (`eip1271 isValidSignature call timed out`,
`mapNonces read failed`, both 503) and its `legacy_on_chain` delivery
returned the literal `Invalid response` (paid, no JSON) - a third
delivery outcome to log as an error; and a second parallel off-chain send
(two requests to service 44 in one tool block) reproduced the 401 nonce
rejection exactly as the rule above predicts, so the sequential-send rule
stands on 3/3 instances.

**Supplied facts steer both tools to near-certainty (2026-09-09 00:1xZ,
FULL cycle, operator machine; `journal/mech-requests.jsonl` rows
phil-20260909-0010-iran-ma-44 and phil-20260909-0012-iran-v4-44).** On the
Iran Sep 7 ceasefire leg (market 4168072, Yes mid 0.35, own No 0.55) the
prompt included the resolution clause AND the fact that CENTCOM struck
tankers at the Kharg and Jask anchorages on Sep 5 and Sep 8. Service 44
market-aware returned p_yes 0.03 (R, researchability 0.95, confidence
0.95) and v4 on the same mech, same prompt, returned p_yes 0.003
(confidence 0.99) - both sequential, both delivered off-chain first try, no
nonce error. Neither output engaged the one open question (does an
anchorage strike count as 'internal waters' or as excluded 'maritime
territory'); both read the supplied fact as decisive. Two lessons for
reading mech deliveries: (1) when the prompt hands the tool a fact, the
tool's confidence is largely MY fact echoed back, so a paired comparison
on such a prompt measures prompt-following, not research - for interpretive
clause questions, send the clause and the question only, and compare
against a second request that adds the facts; (2) the market-aware
delivery's top serper hit was again the Polymarket event page (a 5-day-old
snippet reading '71%'), the fourth price-leak instance, and this time the
leaked number was STALE and on the opposite side of the current price, so
'contaminated' does not even mean 'anchored on the live market'. Grade
both deliveries against the Sep 7 leg's settlement alongside the position
itself (schedule.json watch item, grading item 5).

**Mech prompt front-loading (2026-09-21 20:5xZ, seven R1-window requests).**
The tools build their Serper query from the first ~140-150 characters of
my prompt and show the model only the top 5 organic results. Evidence:
`phil-20260921-2100-opus22b-r1ma-s21` and its blind twin searched "Will
Anthropic make its next Claude Opus model (... Claude Opus 5.5) available
to" - the date fell off the end, and the results were the Opus 5 and 4.5
launch posts; `phil-20260921-2056-musk200-r1ma-s25` lost the week the same
way and got other weeks' event pages. Rule: the first 140 characters of a
mech prompt carry the distinguishing noun AND the date (or the live
quantity's name), e.g. "Claude Opus 5.5 release on September 22, 2026:
will Anthropic ...". Still one `?` sentence, still no price. Second
finding, for grading: retrieval is not repeatable between calls. On the
BTC 90k trio (service 44) the same query 50 seconds apart put the live
Binance price at rank 8 for the R1 pair (outside the top-5 cut, p 0.30 and
0.10) and at ranks 4-5 for the GPT-4.1 baseline (p 0.565). A baseline row
is only a model comparison when `serper_response.organic` top 5 match;
check that before quoting an R1-vs-GPT gap in a retro.

## Watch-item hygiene: schedule.json is a pacing instrument, not a journal (DEEP-2026-09-14)

schedule.json is read by every tick to decide pacing; by 2026-09-14 it
had grown to 87KB (watch_items 75KB), with the Iran item at 31.6KB
carrying 30 near-identical "finding UNCHANGED" paragraphs and the
Andersson item at 14.2KB. That growth pattern is not free: an 87KB file
cannot be printed whole without the tool-output spill that destroyed the
2026-08-28 deep-retro session (output over the harness cap lands in a
permission-gated spill file nobody can approve), and every cycle commit
rewrites the whole blob. The history was also redundant — every one of
those checkpoints already existed in cycles.log, funnel.jsonl, and git.

Rules, effective now:

1. **Checkpoints update IN PLACE.** A re-check that changes nothing
   updates the item's status line (count + latest timestamp, e.g. "30
   consecutive UNCHANGED checks through 2026-09-13 20:1xZ"), it does
   not append a paragraph. A re-check that DOES change the picture
   replaces the stale part of the item and cites the forecast id it
   recorded — the forecast/funnel/retro record is the durable history,
   the watch item is the current state.
2. **~2,000-character soft cap per item.** An item that needs more than
   that is carrying history, not state; move the history to the cycle
   retro and point at it ("full lineage: git/cycles.log/funnel
   <daterange>"). Decision-critical content — clause readings, entry
   facts, pre-registered grading questions, standing instructions —
   always stays in the item; the cap is met by cutting repetition,
   never by cutting the things grading needs.
3. **ARCHIVED items get pruned by the next deep retro** after their
   grading has landed in a retro. Git retains them; the working file
   does not.

Applied 2026-09-14: items 4/5/9/10 compressed to decision-relevant
cores, three ARCHIVED items pruned, 87KB → ~30KB. Nothing needed for
the pending Sweden/Iran/Russia gradings was dropped (verified against
the pre-registrations in item 11 and the clause reading in item 5).

## Grading duty discharged: 0ed1d77858d7 settled LOST, clause-mapping error confirmed (RETRO-20260915-2015)

The Iran Sep7 ceasefire No bet (`0ed1d77858d7`, est 0.93 @0.54, edge
0.39, edge_class info-race) settled **LOST** 2026-09-15 — the market
resolved Yes (clean 14-day window completed). Per the grading duty
pre-registered at line ~300 above (RETRO-20260907-1758 §2), this row is
graded as a **clause-mapping error, not a fact-quality error**: the
CENTCOM Sep 1 strike was correctly sourced and verified multi-source
(condition (i) of the fact-finality gate was genuinely satisfied on the
fact itself), but the entry rationale quoted the clause's own sentence
("...if the most recent qualifying military action occurred on or
before the specified end date") and then read it backwards, calling a
window that the clause explicitly permits to run past the end date
"arithmetically impossible." The 2026-09-07 correction diagnosed this
within 2 days of entry; today's settlement confirms that corrected
diagnosis was right, and no further gate change follows from it — the
gate already requires showing the (a)/(b) clause-to-outcome mapping,
and this loss is exactly the failure that requirement targets.

**Tally update.** This is the first `>0.10-claimed-edge` bet to settle
since the founding set closed at 0W/8L (RETRO-20260901-0639); it
extends the tally to **0W/9L, -$45**. Distinct from the founding set's
failure modes (documented-but-unfinished process: GTA VI, Lake America;
resolver-interpretation: ai-leaderboard), this row is the gate's first
settled instance of a *clause-mapping* failure specifically — worth
tracking as its own sub-shape if a second instance appears, since the
fix (require the explicit (a)/(b) mapping) is different from either of
the other two.

**Second finding, not yet a rule.** The six re-checks after the 2026-09-07
correction (est walking 0.40 → 0.45 → 0.55 → 0.35 → 0.32 → 0.27) held
above the market's No price at every checkpoint from Sep 9 onward, and
the market was closer to the true outcome (No never occurred) at every
one of those checkpoints. Each re-check found a residual reason
("Kharg/Jask anchorage might still be judged qualifying," "a new strike
might still land") to stay above the market rather than converge to it.
One position is not enough to generalize from — flagging as a pattern
to watch: an already-held position with no exit may bias re-checks
toward finding reasons the original thesis still holds rather than
updating fully to the market on the residual risk that justified
staying in. No gate change from n=1; revisit if a second held position
shows the same shape at settlement.

stream needs n most, and where, if an edge exists, it will show first)
over candidates in the n≥9 worse-than-market cells, which get research
time only with a mechanical anchor (official print, transcript count,
cross-market arithmetic). This legislates nothing about bet eligibility;
existing gates decide that. Re-rank at the next deep retro; drop any
"promising" cell that turns flat or positive as its n grows — at current
n all negative deltas are within noise and this is a prioritization
heuristic, not an edge claim.

**DEEP-2026-09-17 re-rank (n=750 settled, overall delta +0.0086, window
added 58 settlements dominated by two correlated word-count events —
Warsh FOMC presser 21 rows, Trump Gastonia rally ~10 rows).** Moves
since yesterday's snapshot, per the re-rank duty above:

- **DROPPED from the promising list: say-the-word** −0.0243 (n=8) →
  −0.0012 (n=42). The Warsh/Gastonia batch flattened it exactly as the
  rule anticipated ("drop any promising cell that turns flat as its n
  grows"). Worse, the window's mid-priced interpretive slice (market
  0.2–0.8, n=17) ran +0.0290 AGAINST us — point-estimate word-frequency
  models on mid-range words lose to the market; the flat aggregate is
  carried by near-certain habit words priced ≥0.85 where we match the
  market. Research priority: only mechanical, margin-clearing threshold
  counts (speaker-only, per the method note), not mid-range presence
  guesses. n caveat: the 31 window rows come from 2 events, so the
  mid-range read is 2 correlated samples, not 17 independent ones.
- **DROPPED: product-release** −0.0921 (n=4) → +0.0631 (n=5). One
  settlement flipped the sign — which is the proof it was noise.
- **ADDED (candidate, same caveats): econ-rates** −0.0322 (n=22), the
  best negative delta at n≥20 after the FOMC cluster settled clean.
  Honest deflator: most of those rows are market-agrees/no-edge skips
  clustered on a handful of Fed events, so the cell is calibration of
  agreement, not evidence of disagreement edge.
- **Holding:** mlb-moneyline −0.0499 (n=15), commodities-touch −0.0461
  (n=10), politics-general −0.0443 (n=11).
- **Worse-than-market cells hardened:** news +0.0362 (n=15) → +0.0581
  (n=33) — the Israel×Lebanon diplomatic-meeting family settled Yes
  against every own-No lean, same multi-channel-process shape as prior
  losses; ai-model-release +0.0607 (n=40), weather +0.0566 (n=34),
  market-microstructure +0.0612 (n=11) unchanged in kind. The
  mechanical-anchor requirement for research time in these cells stands.

**DEEP-2026-09-26 re-rank (n=872 settled, overall delta +0.0083; first
re-rank since 09-17).** The promising list has thinned exactly as the
rule predicted:

- **DROPPED: politics-general** −0.0443 (n=11) → +0.0146 (n=59).
- **DROPPED: econ-rates** −0.0322 (n=22) → +0.0094 (n=22, re-scored).
- **Holding (still small n, still noise-level):** commodities-touch
  −0.0378 (n=14), crypto-touch −0.0307 (n=16; the 9-decision touch
  tally governs it, not this list), mlb-moneyline −0.0499 (n=15, no new
  rows since 09-16 — structurally starved: no ODDS_API_KEY).
- **Hardened worse-than-market: social-media-postcount** +0.0304 (n=23)
  → **+0.0503 (n=36)**, and it took **15 of 44 researched rows** in the
  2026-09-25/26 window (funnel.jsonl), more than any other cell, while
  the category bar means none can be bet. The screener keeps escalating
  Musk/Trump brackets because Haiku's prior is stale, not because the
  book is wrong. **Rule: at most ONE social-media-postcount event
  family per FULL cycle gets research** (all brackets of one
  account-window count as one family), unless it is grading an open
  forecast's pre-registered check. The freed slots go to the holding
  cells above or to an unresearched category. Research priority only,
  no gate change; revisit when postcount delta turns ≤ 0 at n ≥ 50.
- ai-model-release +0.0838 (n=35), weather +0.0495 (n=34), news
  +0.0246 (n=32), market-microstructure +0.0750 (n=9): unchanged in kind.

## DEEP-2026-09-26: record the mechanical read; unmeasured shades go in the note

The hourly agent wrote four separate rules in one day (playbook lines
tagged RETRO-20260925-1812, -2015, -2213, and RETRO-20260926-0415 logged
the fifth instance for this retro) that all say one thing. The
shaded-vs-raw tally they pre-asked for, one row per independent event:

| Event | Mechanical read | Recorded (shade) | Shade source | Brier effect of shade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Musk Sep 18-25 weekly (`431d16dbbd6f`, `4b1aec60bfc7`) | bootstrap 0.50-0.525 / 0.273 | 0.40 / 0.30 | short-run slowdown | worse (+0.134, +0.046) |
| Dem Senate odds bands Sep 25 (3 rows) | driftless normal 0.49/0.39 | 0.44/0.44 | week-drift momentum | worse (family 0.510 vs 0.414) |
| PLTR HIGH $195 (`a468e40297ae`) | touch.py from close 0.678 | 0.74 | NQ-beta inferred open | worse (+0.088) |
| Volynets–Birrell (`b5774501ec4c`) | single-book devig 0.636 | 0.68 | toward market consensus | worse (+0.058) |
| SPY LOW $760 (`23a99c8fe4e8`) | touch.py 0.118 | 0.08 | **measured** ES overnight print | better (−0.0075) |
| Bondar–Ruse (`8785a067de69`, added RETRO-20260926-0615) | single-book devig 0.591 | 0.60 | toward market consensus | worse (+0.011) |

Unmeasured shades: 0 for 4 independent events (sign test p≈0.06
one-sided, small n, but the direction has never flipped). Update
RETRO-20260926-0615: 0 for 5 (p≈0.03 one-sided). The one shade
grounded in a measured, quoted input helped. **General rule (replaces
the four per-category copies, which stay as the evidence log):** when a
row has a named mechanical or benchmark read (touch.py, a bootstrap, a
driftless resolver-series model, a devigged book, a nowcast), est_prob
IS that read. A shade enters est_prob only when it is driven by a
measured print quoted in the note (source + number + timestamp).
Anything else, including recency, momentum, "the market thinks
otherwise" and inferred opens, is written as "shade view: X" in the note
and not recorded. Two scoped exceptions, both about a DEFECTIVE input
rather than a shade: (a) the liquid near-certain sibling rule
(RETRO-20260926-0015, Trump Truth `c5737eab7350`), and (b) the
official-figure centring rule for turnout/seat counts (RETRO-20260925-
1421). **Tally continues:** every settled row whose note carries a
"shade view" gets one line in its retro: raw Brier vs shade Brier.
The next deep retro to see ≥ 8 independent events re-grades this rule. If
shades are winning by then, relax it. This changes recording, not bet
eligibility: every existing gate still decides whether a row can bet.

## DEEP-2026-09-16: position-holding re-check bias, pre-registered as a graded pattern

RETRO-20260915-2015's second finding, hardened from a loose flag into
something falsifiable. Pattern: an already-held position with no exit
mechanism may bias re-checks toward reasons the thesis still holds
rather than converging to the market (Iran 0ed1d77858d7: six
post-correction re-checks all held own-No above market-No; market was
closer at every checkpoint from Sep 9 on). Rule, effective now: when a
held-to-resolution position that accumulated ≥3 re-check estimates
settles, the settling retro must grade the re-check chain — count
checkpoints where own est was closer to the outcome than the
contemporaneous market price, and append one line here:
`<ledger id>: own-closer k of m checkpoints`. Current tally: Iran
0ed1d77858d7: own-closer 0 of 6 (post-correction chain). If the tally
reaches 3 positions with own-closer in a minority of checkpoints,
enact a convergence rule (re-checks that find no NEW qualifying fact
must supersede toward the market, not hold); until then this is
bookkeeping only. Candidates in flight: MV CDU 23e40bbbccc5 (already ≥4
re-checks), Sweden next-PM e746d7e1ba99, Russia UR 9074e3f2fd49.

## Two reachable benchmarks found on first contact (2026-09-17 16:0xZ, FULL cycle, operator machine)

Method notes, not rule changes: no gate, floor or veto moves until the rows
below settle. Evidence is the research record of this cycle (forecast ids
inline); grading duties sit in the schedule.json watch items.

**1. Commodity touch ladders: read the Active Month clause before the
spot price.** The WTI "hit (HIGH/LOW) $X in September" rules define the
Active Month as rolling to the next contract at the start of the second
trading session before the front contract's last trading session. For
September 2026 that is 22:00Z Sep 17 (Oct LTD Tue Sep 22), and the curve
was in steep backwardation: Oct 100.78, Nov 96.27, Dec 92.12
(oilprice.com). From the headline ~$100.5 "spot", LOW $95 at 0.81 and
LOW $90 at 0.50 look absurd; against the Nov contract they are fair. With
a SOURCED vol input (OVX 57.49, FRED OVXCLS - the first non-guessed vol
in the commodities-touch cell, which the touch-family ruling requires) a
martingale reflection model on S=96.27 with 9 sessions left reproduced
six of seven PM rungs within 0.05 (LOW90 0.553 vs 0.50, LOW85 0.268 vs
0.23, HIGH105 0.420 vs 0.43, HIGH110 0.205 vs 0.20). The market prices
the roll and prices at implied vol. The one rung off the model was LOW95
(0.909 vs ask 0.81). Forecast-only under the touch-family gate
(18672a24a234, 98134efdddcf, 0ad60d107c54, 52fac91e76d7, 41c92e76901c).
The Aug 18 first test (8 legs, guessed 38pct vol, front-month spot) never
read this clause; any re-read of those rows should check whether a roll
fell inside that window before blaming the vol input.

**2. PCE brackets: the Fed chair's presser opening statement carries a
staff estimate.** After CPI and PPI, the opening statement gives the
staff translation to 12-month PCE (Sep 16: total "around 3.6 percent",
core "about 3.2 percent"). It is a named, dated, primary source, and it
is reachable from this runner (the PDF needs the stdlib zlib extraction;
poppler is absent). On first contact it sat 0.2 below the Cleveland Fed
nowcast on BOTH total and core (3.78 / 3.40), and bank trackers split the
same way (GS 3.16 vs BofA 3.4), attributed to the annual revisions
landing in the same BEA release. PM's modal bucket was 3.3, the July
print, which neither camp forecasts. One standard-floor bet, 3.3 No
(8894592b953a, edge 0.08); the 3.2 Yes leg stayed vetoed (edge 0.13,
spread 0.10) because the staff estimate's hit rate is recalled, not
sourced - gate 2's variance clause, unchanged. If the revision camp is
right at settlement, the next step is to source that hit rate (chair
statement vs printed value, 2024 on) so the carve-out can be tested on
it; if wrong, record that "running at about" is looser than the
Powell-era formula and stop treating it as a staff point estimate.

**Mech, same cycle (3 market-aware + 1 paired v4, all off-chain first
try, context delivered: `market_prob_seen` equalled the sent price on all
three).** The tool's retrieval missed the decisive current fact on every
question: the Warsh/GS/BofA numbers (PCE), the revision variance (UMich,
p_independent 0.85 on "prelim is inside the bracket"), and the November
contract price (WTI, although the prompt spelled out the roll).
Polymarket-derived pages ranked in the serper top 7 on two of three (UMich: June
event page #1 and a stale "27%" snippet; WTI: event page #1, laikalabs
"76%", chanceindex), price-leak instances five and six. Grade at
settlement; nothing to act on yet.

## News-cell process-shape bar (enacted RETRO-20260918-1518)

**Rule.** In category `news`, a candidate is **forecast-only** (skip-reason
`process-shape-bar`, no `place`) when all three hold:

1. the question is "will a government, agency, or institution do or
   complete X by a date";
2. the process is documented as active (a program that has shipped before,
   a named official saying work continues, talks under way);
3. my P(Yes) is below the market's P(Yes), at any edge size.

Record the forecast exactly as before, honest estimate included. The bar
changes bet eligibility only.

**Evidence.** Five settled news bets have this shape and all five lost,
-$25: `d2dd24206542` (ceasefire Jul 31, No at 0.92), `bbe450e04eb9` and
`6f7dfb5b7c0c` (Lake America, No at 0.668 and 0.38), `0ed1d77858d7` (Iran
ceasefire Sep 7, No at 0.54), `d8892ff1a36a` (UFO files, No at 0.139). At
the prices paid the market gave that joint outcome 0.0065; my estimates
gave it 0.000008. The two Lake America rows are one event family: four
independent observations. The proximate failure differed each time (clause
mapping, unfinished-process read, cadence read). The common factor is
reading "not done yet" as "may not get done" on a process the market can
also see. `d8892ff1a36a` was the deliberate fair trial: sub-0.10 edge,
outside-view shrink already applied (raw 0.72 -> 0.78), and the market's
0.875 was still closer. The shrink is therefore not a sufficient fix, and
it is retired as a route to a bet in this shape.

**Exception.** A dated official fact that maps to No through the clause
itself: the actor states the act will not happen before the deadline, or a
scheduled date falls after it. That goes through the fact-finality gate
with the explicit (a)/(b) clause-to-outcome mapping, as today. "No release
found in N searches" and "the cadence has slipped" are absences, not facts,
and never qualify.

**Not covered.** Own-Yes leans in the news cell (n=1, `b21e42c123a1`, a
different failure), other categories, and mechanical anchors (official
print, transcript count, cross-market arithmetic).

**Settled tally (RETRO-20261001-0625).** 3 bar-blocked rows settled, CF
2W/1L, -$1.24 (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
process-shape-bar`): US-Iran meeting `e36a44d978b6` +$2.35 and Saudi
pipeline `8e2446683bf4` +$1.41 (own below mid, resolved No, own closer:
dBrier -0.0605 / -0.0360), Trump renames AI `f85a9b197bc6` -$5.00. Net
still negative and n=3; no change. Revisit at 10 settled rows.
Update RETRO-20261001-1015: +1, Russia-Ukraine meeting by Sep30
`a0a3361a49c1` 0.08 vs 0.13, resolved No, own closer (dBrier -0.0105),
CF +$0.68. Now 4 settled, CF 3W/1L, -$0.55. No change.
Update RETRO-20261006-1230: +1, Saudi pipeline by Oct15 `3d73de289a35`
0.22 vs 0.335, resolved Yes (flows back to normal per Bloomberg Oct 5),
book closer (dBrier +0.173), CF -$5.00. Now 5 settled, CF 3W/2L, -$5.55,
dBrier +0.045. The bar kept a losing No off the ledger. No change.

**Re-open condition.** Rows skipped under this bar are graded as their own
slice at each deep retro. When 10 have settled, lift the bar if their
forecast brier_delta is at or below 0; keep it otherwise. Until then, the
DEEP-2026-09-16 allocation rule already says these rows get research time
only with a mechanical anchor, so the bar should cost few research slots.

**Mech note, same settlement.** Market-aware `p_independent` on the UFO row
was 0.72, identical to my raw hazard read, and both sat 0.15 under a market
that was right. Its price-informed `p_yes` 0.82 beat me (brier 0.0324
versus 0.0484) and lost to the mid (0.0154). n=1 in the post-2026-09-14
window; no paired v4 on this market.

**First settled mech pair in the window (RETRO-20260921-1330, market
1130012, UR gains most seats, outcome Yes).** Service 21, requests dated
2026-09-17. Brier in question frame: market-aware `p_independent` 0.88 ->
0.0144, market-aware `p_yes` 0.86 -> 0.0196, mid 0.755 -> 0.0600, own
recorded 0.65 -> 0.1225, v4 blind 0.62 -> 0.1444, own pre-mech 0.59 ->
0.1681. Market-aware beat the price, me and v4; the price pulled it 0.02
the wrong way, and its lead over v4 came from retrieval (page bodies
against snippets). I took about a quarter of the gap to a delivery with
researchability 0.95, class R, `parse_tier` clause. Window tally:
market-aware settled rows 2, settled pairs 1. No weighting rule at this n;
re-read at 5 settled pairs.

## Record-time category tag is immutable — check it before recording (DEEP-2026-09-20)

**Rule.** The `category` on a forecast (or bet) row is set once, at record
time, by me — and only core writes the journals, so a wrong tag can never
be corrected afterward. Before calling the record step, confirm the
category matches the event's actual sport/domain, especially on
sibling-census sweeps where several rows are recorded in one pass. If a
tag is discovered wrong *before* recording, fix it; discovering it wrong
*after* recording (as at 14:19Z on 2026-09-19) leaves a permanent alien
row in a graded cell.

**Evidence.** Forecast `32f25ca85db8` (BYU vs. Colorado State, an NCAAF
game) was recorded under `mlb-spreads` on the 2026-09-19 14:19Z FULL
cycle; the cycle summary itself flagged it as mis-recorded in the same
breath, so the information existed before the write. It settled
2026-09-20 (WON, no-edge skip, dB −0.0038) and now sits permanently in
the `mlb-spreads` forecast cell. One row is noise today, but per-cell
`brier_delta` is the instrument this whole experiment steers by
(research-allocation rule, DEEP-2026-09-16), and cells are small — a
handful of alien rows is enough to flip a small-n cell's sign.

**Reading rule until further notice.** When quoting the `mlb-spreads`
forecast cell, note it contains one NCAAF row (`32f25ca85db8`). Do not
hand-edit journals to "fix" it — journals are core-written, full stop.

## DEEP-2026-09-22: where the skill lives — the by-class ledger the next fortnight answers to

All-time settled forecasts by skip_reason (own-side Brier vs the mid at
record, n=846; bet rows use entry forecasts; cross-checked against
`counterfactual.py` +0.0342 on the veto slice, same run):

| class | n | dBrier |
|---|---|---|
| bet (entry forecasts) | 23 | **+0.080** |
| outside-view-veto | 151 | +0.034 |
| market-agrees | 122 | +0.006 |
| no-edge | 429 | +0.002 (at-market by construction) |
| category-bar | 29 | +0.002 |
| unvalidated-method | 34 | **−0.013** |
| wide-spread-veto | 16 | **−0.045** |

And the bet book by placement era (n=41 settled): placed before Sep 1 —
27 rows, −$31.67, dBrier +0.125; Sep 1–10 — 10 rows, +$34.65, +0.056
(the P&L is one MLB moneyline outlier +$31.23); Sep 11+ — 4 rows,
−$20.00, +0.083. Every era loses to the market; the improvement is real
(the −1.0-ROI news/leaderboard/product-release rows are all pre-Sep)
but no era has ever been ahead.

**The structural fact:** the only two classes where own beats the
market are both forecast-only by rule — the measured-vol touch family
(inside unvalidated-method; re-graded 2026-09-23 at 7 rows / 5
informative decisions, stays forecast-only, next bar pre-registered at
10 decisions, see the touch-family section) and the
wide-spread-veto slice (barred by max_spread; n=17 and dBrier −0.0327
as of 2026-09-23, small) — while the
class that actually bets is the worst in the book. The conclusion is
NOT to promote either slice today: both have pre-registered triggers,
and a deep retro that jumps a trigger because the table looks tempting
is the exact post-hoc move the fork discipline exists to prevent
(2026-09-22's fork status, two consecutive double-gate failures, shows
what jumping would cost). The conclusion is a priority ordering for
research allocation until a trigger fires:

1. ~~Feed the touch-family counter its 6th measured row~~ RETIRED
   DEEP-2026-09-24: at 7 informative decisions own is closer on 2, so
   the pre-registered 60% bar is unreachable at 10 (see the touch-family
   section). Record scan-surfaced touch rows only incidentally; do not
   select them ahead of other candidates.
2. Keep election self-model bets behind the price-inside-range rule and
   the centre stress test; the German week (bets −$10, veto CF rows
   2W/3L, market better on ~14 of 14 settled German rows) is this
   family's third strike as a betting class in three countries.
3. The mlb-moneyline cell (−0.0499, n=15, best in the book) stays
   starved until ODDS_API_KEY lands on a runner — an operator ask, not
   a strategy choice; nothing to do here but keep the cell's n growing
   on scan-surfaced games.

Audited and endorsed this pass (details in DEEP-2026-09-22.md): the
price-inside-the-model-range rule, the no-bet-against-the-poll-trend
rule and momentum joint verdict, the sd floor 3.0/2.5 with the centre
stress test, the managed-election centring note, the WTI stale-window
rule, the touch-counter pinning with the shade drop (caveat: the
re-grade tests the UNSHADED method — 3 of the 5 counted rows were
recorded shaded, say so when grading), and the tennis consistency rule.
Reverts: none.

## R1 mech-evaluation protocol: baseline always, and a daily sample that settles (operator note 2026-09-21 ~21:25Z, integrated 2026-09-22 ~14:1xZ)

The 2026-09-21 ~21:25Z operator note changed how the mech step's R1
evaluation has to be run, superseding CYCLE.md 5a's older "at least one
candidate per cycle" baseline language. Checked against today's
`journal/mech-requests.jsonl` before integrating: of the UTC-day's
requests so far, only ONE market (4658702) had carried the full
R1-aware / R1-blind / GPT-4.1-aware triple — the gap this note exists to
close. Encoding it here since CYCLE.md itself is not mine to edit and a
rule that lives only in an operator note gets missed by the next cycle
that doesn't happen to re-read it word for word (exactly what happened
today: four FULL cycles since the note posted, 00:30Z/04:16Z/06:19Z/
08:23Z/10:14Z, none logged acting on it).

- **Baseline always, not "at least one."** Every candidate that gets
  the R1 pair (market-aware + blind) also gets the third request,
  `superforcaster-market-aware` (GPT-4.1) with the same context, same
  mech, sent sequentially last. No baseline means the eventual
  four-way settlement line has a hole and R1 can't be compared to the
  model it's replacing.
- **A sample that settles.** Each UTC day, send the full three-request
  set on at least 3 *researchable* markets (elections, rulings,
  launches, scheduled decisions, dated public-record counts — not
  live asset prices) that settle within 5 days, even on candidates
  where the trade itself is skipped. Record the forecast as usual with
  its real skip reason so it settles and grades. If the day's scan
  doesn't surface 3 such candidates, say so in the cycle summary rather
  than lowering the research bar to manufacture a count.
- **Report researchable and price markets as two separate groups** in
  retros and deep retros, each with its own settled-n and cumulative
  Brier line (R1 market-aware / R1 blind / GPT-4.1 market-aware / own /
  market). The published R1 evaluation excluded short-term asset
  prices, so the researchable group is the fair test of the tool and
  the price group is context only — keep sending the price-market set
  when one comes up anyway, just don't count it toward the sample-of-3.

Nothing else about the mech step changes: own estimate first, one
precise question with the date near the front (front-loading rule
above), no price in the prompt text, sequential sends, `mechlog.py
record` on every attempt including failures. This cycle's own research
step counts toward today's sample-of-3 tally.

## DEEP-2026-09-27 additions

**One label for view-count brackets: `video-views`.** The MrBeast
v9QtM6qnG50 wk1 family (settled 2026-09-26) was recorded under three
labels in two days: `youtube-views` (92a9d80fc3c3, 8adb0a184d87),
`social-media-views` (7a449ce9, 675f8739, d842a0332a5a, 5badc7031d2c,
4296dbe5, 2437bc1e) and `video-views` (20a3bf4a, 32042307). All earlier
rows (2026-08-28 to 09-05, n=7) used `video-views`. Split labels break
the per-category brier_delta that the category bar reads. From now on,
any "will video X reach N views" bracket is `video-views`. Post and tweet
COUNTS stay `social-media-postcount`. Old rows are not rewritten
(forecasts.jsonl is append-only). Pool the three labels by hand when you
quote the cell.

**Refusal rows distort a veto ledger's dBrier.** The wide-spread-veto
ledger went from dBrier −0.0279 to −0.0444 on one row, f7fcd3a05a31. That
row is a refusal (no ask, bid-only mid 0.36 against an already-confirmed
M6.6). Its market prob is not a price anyone could trade at, so it adds
−0.409 of Brier "edge" that no fill could have realized. When quoting
wide-spread-veto or outside-view-veto dBrier for a boundary decision,
quote it WITH and WITHOUT refusals. The P&L column already excludes them.
The veto boundary stays unchanged. Its fillable P&L is still −$25.04 over
20 trades.

## DEEP-2026-09-28 notes

- **Settled watch items move to `strategy/watch-archive.md`.** Once every
  id a `schedule.json` watch item carries has settled AND been graded in
  a retro, move the item verbatim to the archive instead of leaving an
  "ARCHIVED:" stub in the file every tick reads. Eleven items went today
  (schedule.json 82KB -> 69KB). Keep an item while any joint grading it
  names is still owed (the Sweden trio waits on e746d7e1ba99; the Sep 20
  joint set waits on its last open leg).
- **Crypto touch keeps drifting toward the market.** The cell went
  −0.0307 (n=16, DEEP-2026-09-24) to **−0.0204 (n=19)**. All three
  Sep 21-27 weekly touch rows settled this window with own further from
  the outcome than the mid (efa75442 +0.009, 6f5b7cf4 +0.006, fd59af69
  BTC $88k own 0.41 vs 0.285, +0.087). This confirms the 2026-09-24
  retirement of touch rows as a research priority. Do not re-open it on
  the cell's still-negative sign: it is shrinking toward zero with n.
- **Scheduled-close crypto uses ladder-implied sd (5eed485): kept.** The
  rule fixes a real method error (3 of 3 realized-vol reads were wider
  than the ladder and lost to it). Forecast-only stands; re-grade at n=8.

## New benchmark: Parcl Labs daily index, readable via public API (2026-09-29 00:3xZ, FULL cycle, cloud)

Polymarket's "median home value in <city> on <date>" bracket sets resolve on
the Parcl Labs Sales Price Index (price/sqft x a fixed sqft multiplier stated
in the market text). The resolution page is JS-rendered, but the page's own
data call is public and keyless:
`POST https://api-app-service.parcllabs.com/v1/price-feeds/history` with
`{"parcl_ids":[<id>],"start_date":"2020-01-01"}` returns the daily series.
**Validation:** today's history matched all 4 resolved NYC brackets (Feb 1,
Mar 1, Apr 1, Apr 30 2026; two sat within 0.7 idx of an edge and still
agreed). So the published history is the resolver's value, and late revisions
are not a live risk on that evidence.

Method: take the latest print, measure the index move needed to cross each
bracket edge by the resolution date, and read the empirical frequency of
that move over 2020-26 horizon-matched changes, both unconditional and
conditioned on a similar prior 2-day trend. **Bet rule for first contact:**
bet only legs where the conditional sample has ZERO crossings and the
unconditional rate is <= ~3%. Legs whose outcome depends on momentum
continuing (SF 1.176M edge, DC 524K edge) stay forecast-only. Placed
3c4304fb1d0a NYC 663-689K, 95624b8c75a0 Chicago 340-345K, 22456f76e62d LA
1.153-1.169M ($5 each, edge_class other). Forecast-only: DC 9160ae7137c4
(no-edge), SF 7f5d8917f569 (outside-view-veto, 0.11), US 02d351f38d7d /
db7b69c95a4b (market-agrees).
**Pre-registered grading (Sep 30 values, settle ~Oct 1):** if all three bets
win and the DC/SF forecasts land on the side the momentum read implied, keep
the zero-crossing rule and extend it to the next monthly set. Any loss on a
zero-crossing leg means the empirical tail understates the resolver's
variance, so the family goes forecast-only. The same applies if a leg settles
on a value that differs from the API history for that date. These three legs
share one data source and one method, so grade them as ONE decision, not
three independent outcomes.

**Graded 2026-09-30 (RETRO-20260930-1615): pre-registered condition MET.**
All three bets won: NYC, Chicago and LA, +$1.37 total. DC 524K+ Yes and SF
<1.176M Yes both landed on the momentum side. A re-read of the public
history at 16:2xZ gives NYC Sep 30 = 679.19 (i.e. $679,190), in the
settled bracket. That makes the resolver match 5/5 NYC dates. All 12 Parcl
forecast rows landed on the favoured side, but the realised edge is thin
(housing-index dBrier -0.010, n=9) because the book already sat at
0.87-0.97. **Ruling: keep the zero-crossing bet rule and extend it to the
next monthly set** (Oct 31 brackets), at the same flat $5 and with the
same momentum legs kept forecast-only. The Oct set still takes the
DEEP-2026-09-29 family cap of $10 total open stake, as that ruling says. This counts as ONE settled decision
(n=1 event), not three. A loss on any zero-crossing leg still sends the
family forecast-only.

## DEEP-2026-09-29 rulings

- **AI release-date anchoring rule (abb6dcc): KEPT.** The "7 of 7" count
  covers about 3 markets, not 7: 298455f0923c was superseded by
  b5144f22aaaa, and the four Opus rows cover two or three rungs of one
  launch. So the effective evidence is about **2 launch events** (Opus
  and Sonnet 5.5), and both came earlier than the leak-based lean said.
  I still keep the rule. The category-level number stands on its own
  (ai-model-release forecasts n=35, dBrier +0.0838). The rule only moves
  est_prob to the mid, and it keeps the lean in the note, so its
  downside is capped at "no information added". Re-grade the shade
  views at n=8 **distinct markets**, not n=8 rows.
- **Treasury touch drift rule (4fb1a1d): KEPT, SHARPENED.** The "5 of 5"
  is also rows, not markets. fdedb184ad3e -> 8b9d86b667bb ->
  3ed526b57eca is one 10y 5.20% market re-recorded three times, so the
  evidence is **3 markets** (30y 5.39%, 10y 5.20%, 30y 5.55%) plus one
  raw-bootstrap win (99df204b7f85), all from a single September ladder
  in which yields trended up. "Drift kept" beats "driftless" exactly
  when the trend continues, so this is one regime, not a method proof.
  The rule stays because it only governs what goes into a forecast-only
  row. At the October ladder re-grade, split the grading by whether the
  month trended. If a flat or reversing month shows the raw-drift est
  losing to the mid, revert to the mid (not to driftless).
- **NEW: feed-backed families get a mechanical look that does not
  depend on screener divergence (sensing).** The Parcl home-value
  family was in the scan pool and screened **362 times over 14 days
  (Sep 16-29)**. Every row had divergence 0.0, confidence `low`, and a
  reason like "Need current Parcl Labs home value data". The screener
  prompt says to do exactly that (it cannot browse), and escalation
  ranks by divergence, so a family whose answer is one keyless API call
  away could never reach research. One direct lookup (00:3xZ Sep 29)
  produced 3 floor-clearing bets. Since Sep 22, 6,344 of 16,800
  screened rows (38%) are this "no data, echo the mid" shape, mostly
  crypto/Treasury/WTI rungs that already have methods. Rule: keep a
  short list of **validated-feed families**, meaning the resolver's
  source is readable keyless and a past resolution was matched against
  it. Each FULL cycle checks ONE family from the list outside the 15
  escalation slots, rotating, and records forecasts for every leg read.
  The initial list is Parcl home-value (4/4 NYC resolutions matched)
  and USGS M5.5+ weekly counts (aea0ebb45997 won on the count). A
  family is added only after a resolution-match check. **Retire the
  sweep** if 7 days of rotation produce no leg with ask-edge >= min_edge
  outside the Parcl set. This rule is about sensing only. It grants no
  betting permission beyond the existing floors and family rules.
- **NEW: first-contact family stake cap (discipline).** Until a new
  benchmark family has its first settlement, the TOTAL open stake across
  that family is capped at max_stake_per_event_usd ($10), even when the
  legs are nominally different events. The 09-29 Parcl trio (3c4304fb1d0a,
  95624b8c75a0, 22456f76e62d, $15 total) complied with every written
  floor. The playbook itself says to grade them as ONE decision, though,
  because the resolver-equals-API assumption is shared, and a $15
  single-thesis exposure is above what the per-event cap exists to
  enforce. The precedent is the Lake America pair (bbe450e04eb9 +
  6f7dfb5b7c0c), one shared thesis at -$10, which the cap contained.
  This is not a violation on record, since no written rule was broken.
  It applies from now on, including to the October Parcl set if the
  09-30 grade passes.
- **Canada GDP flash->first-print method: first settled validation
  (RETRO-20260929-1545).** Jul 2026: flash "essentially unchanged",
  print 0.0%. Bet 05333272be9d (0.0-0.1 Yes, own 0.63 vs ask 0.57) won
  +$3.77, dBrier -0.048. Both sibling forecasts (<0 at 0.25, 0.2-0.3 at
  0.11) also beat the mid. Keep the 14-month flash-error table as the
  benchmark for StatCan monthly GDP brackets. Any directional tilt layered
  on top (the Jul "tilt up" from the wholesale revision) is unvalidated:
  cap it at 0.05 of bracket mass until it has its own graded evidence.

## DEEP-2026-09-30 rulings

- **Per-settlement counterfactual arithmetic goes in the retro, not
  here.** Seven "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ update: N rows settled" sections
  (Sep 26-29) restated `core/counterfactual.py ledger` totals, and each
  ended "Ruling: no boundary change". That was about 8KB in four days,
  none of it a rule. They moved verbatim to `strategy/playbook-archive.md`.
  From now on, a CF settlement is graded in the RETRO file. The playbook
  gains a line only when a boundary, gate or method changes. The
  mechanical ledger is authoritative, so the hand-kept table under
  "Outside-view veto: settled counterfactual ledger" stays frozen as
  `core/counterfactual.py reconcile`'s input. Do not append to it.
- **Rules carried out of the archived sections (unchanged, still live):**
  - JOLTS: record the LinkUp model centre. Do not tilt past consensus on
    soft signals. The cap is zero past consensus until there is graded
    evidence. For StatCan GDP the cap is 0.05 of bracket mass.
    (RETRO-20260929-1800, n=1, wash.)
  - Econ ladders: record every bracket whose book was read, centre
    included. (The Aug JOLTS print landed in an unrecorded bracket.)
  - Unexplained price moves against a public-record-search estimate:
    **tracked observation, 1-for-2, not a rule.** The Sep 21 Opus case:
    discounting the move was right. The Sep 29 Trump-renames-AI chain
    e22fb0445ebe: the market was right. Third instance (RETRO-20261004-0215):
    Trump-Milei Sep meeting, mid fell 0.775->0.605 with no sourced cause,
    I shaded only 0.75->0.66 (5df207771b03) and it resolved Yes: discounting
    was right (dBrier -0.040 vs mid). Now 2-for-3 for discounting. Re-visit
    result: keep it an observation, n=3 is too small for a rule, but a
    partial shade (hold most of the sourced read, move <= half way) has
    not lost in the three cases; prefer it over full deference.
- **Funnel row is not optional on a FULL cycle.** Two of the seven FULL
  cycles in the Sep 29 window wrote "Funnel: screened 300, escalated 15"
  into cycles.log but committed no `strategy/funnel.jsonl` row: 41b031e
  (15:51Z cloud) and d43503c (18:35Z operator). The screener rows landed
  and the funnel row did not. Before committing a FULL cycle, check that
  `tail -1 strategy/funnel.jsonl` carries this cycle's timestamp.
- **Grade settlements on the tick that settles them, LIGHT included.**
  This is already the schedule.json `_comment` rule. The hourly agent
  reports it being missed (proposal 2026-09-29 18:0xZ: Canada GDP was
  graded 70 minutes late, JOLTS about 2h late). It is restated here, near
  the rulings every FULL cycle reads, until the CYCLE.md wording is fixed.
- **Category tag on a superseding row: copy the superseded row's tag.**
  The Trump-renames-AI chain went politics-general (f0f55638c536) ->
  news (f85a9b197bc6, e22fb0445ebe). This breaks the DEEP-2026-09-20
  immutable-tag rule. It also moved the question into the news cell's
  process-shape bar mid-chain. If the first tag was wrong, say so in the
  note and keep it anyway. Cell stats depend on one market = one cell.
- **RBA 4ed738b2045b (cross-market, LOST −$5): no rule, n=1.** The
  hourly lesson stands as an observation. The lesson: a single
  central-bank futures read 13 days out, used to fade a PM price that
  leans the same direction but further, is a weak cross-market basis.
  PM led futures to the decision. If a second CB fade of this shape
  loses, make it a rule: cross-market needs a futures read within 72h of
  the decision.

## Validated-feed list addition: IMF PortWatch chokepoint 7-day MA (2026-09-30 12:4xZ, FULL cycle, cloud)

Resolution-match check done, per the DEEP-2026-09-29 sensing rule ("a
family is added only after a resolution-match check"). The Bab el-Mandeb
monthly-end bracket sets resolve on PortWatch's trailing 7-day MA of
`n_total`. The keyless ArcGIS layer `Daily_Chokepoints_Data`
(services9.arcgis.com/weJ1QsnbMYJlCHdG, `portname like '%Mandeb%'`,
portid chokepoint4) reproduces both settled sets: Jul 31 MA 29.57 ->
"28-30" Yes, Aug 31 MA 24.57 -> "<25" Yes. Two findings for pricing:
brackets are `[lo, next lo)` on the unrounded MA (29.57 sat in "28-30"),
and publication lags ~3 days (Sep 27 was the latest row on Sep 30), so at
month-end 4 of the 7 MA days are already known. First read: forecasts
8ca04df50d34 / ee209d78c082 / 79386cdeeda6, all no-edge (best 0.025 on
"<25" No). The book put 7.5c on "<25" against 1c on "30-34" while the
series gave 0/28 3-day windows low enough, so the low side may carry AIS
information I cannot see. Grade that skew at settlement. The list is now
Parcl, USGS M5.5+, PortWatch chokepoint MA. Hormuz uses the same layer
but the zero-transit rows are min-touch on daily counts, not the MA, so
the match check does not carry over to them. **2026-10-07
(RETRO-20261007-0445):** both Hormuz legs have now settled consistent
with the PortWatch daily series (Sep30 No, Oct31 Yes). The day-level
match (which date was the zero) is still owed. On the one graded long
leg (d910eebe71cd), shrinking the raw hazard 0.50 toward a
flat-term-structure book gave 0.38 and cost Brier (0.384 vs 0.250 raw,
0.624 mid). Pre-registered, not yet a rule: the next PortWatch min-touch
row writes `raw=<p>` in its note next to the recorded estimate, so the
shrink itself can be graded.

## Settlement grading on every tick type (2026-10-07, RETRO-20261007-0445)

CYCLE.md step 3 says "positions", but here a settled FORECAST counts too
(schedule.json _comment, DEEP-2026-09-02). On a TRIGGERED tick, read
resolve.py's forecast count before deciding there is no retro to write.
Evidence: on the 2026-10-07 01:59Z TRIGGERED tick, resolve settled
d910eebe71cd (an OVV row, CF +$16.74) and 3f0a133362f6, and the log
said "retro skipped per step3 'positions'". It is the third instance
(2026-09-08, 2026-09-11, 2026-10-07).

## Forecast hygiene: supersede the stale sibling in the same cycle (2026-09-30 18:15Z, LIGHT retro)

When research on one market leads me to write that an open forecast on
another market is "now likely wrong", I record the superseding row on
that market in the same cycle. The row uses the same category tag and
states the new estimate. A note on the sibling row does not update the
measured forecast. Evidence: RETRO-20260930-1815. Xiaomi row
367d2b7c6fe4 (Sep 27) flagged Alibaba row a733d6439c5a (0.88) as stale.
No Alibaba row followed, and 0.88 stood for three days until Alibaba
resolved No.

## DEEP-2026-10-01 rulings

- **Funnel row, third miss.** f3bf184 (2026-10-01 04:25Z FULL, cloud)
  appended 300 screener rows, placed bet 50d06b8745c2, and wrote no
  funnel row. The DEEP-2026-09-30 rule sat at line ~7,090, below where a
  default Read stops. It is now also in the reading note at the top of
  this file. The deep retro backfilled the row from cycles.log and the
  schedule.json reason, flagged `"backfilled_by": "DEEP-2026-10-01"` with
  the pool counts left null. The mechanical fix is still the operator
  CI proposal.
- **Touch markets: any "agent better" claim lives on one side only.**
  Settled crypto-touch + commodities-touch forecasts, split by the sign
  of est - mid at record: agent BELOW the mid by more than 0.05, n=9,
  dBrier -0.064 (0 of 9 touched). Within 0.05, n=34, -0.001. ABOVE by
  more than 0.05, n=18, **+0.061**. In commodities-touch alone the
  split is -0.087 (n=6) vs +0.142 (n=7). This window's worst rows are
  all on the above side: gas $4.50 27fd401006d8 0.85 vs 0.59 (+0.374)
  and 1a0bd265abba 0.94 vs 0.58 (+0.547), SPY 770 2256384bac80 0.70 vs
  0.57 (+0.165, guessed vol), and BTC dip 82.5K c8853475ea55 0.70 vs
  0.575 (+0.159). Touch stays `unvalidated-method`, so this changes no
  bet. Any future proposal to validate the touch method must report the
  two sides separately and must not cite the pooled lifetime cell (for
  example commodities-touch -0.034), because the pooled number hides the
  above-mid losses. The n is small (27 rows off-market).
  This is a reporting rule, not an edge claim.
  Tally update RETRO-20261001-0815: +1 below-mid row (STRC cc3d96bd803f
  -0.0191) and +8 within-0.05 rows (WTI Sep ladder, sum -0.0161). Now
  below n=10, within n=42, above n=18 (unchanged). Same direction.
  Tally update RETRO-20261001-1815: +1 within-0.05 row (BTC 85K Oct1
  781d15889c87, own 0.35 shaded from touch.py 0.43, mid 0.325, touched,
  -0.0331). Now below n=10, within n=43, above n=18. When shading a touch
  estimate toward the mid, put the unshaded touch.py value in the note so
  shaded-vs-raw can be graded.
  Tally update RETRO-20261002-1420: EWY191 abe6aeb75082 below-mid
  (-0.075) touched, +0.0416 (first below-mid row to touch); EWY190
  c26fb878d897 above-mid, -0.0533; NVDA236 d53a9e991f6b empty book
  (spread 0.55), excluded. Now below n=11, within n=43, above n=19.
  **Spot-through-barrier shades are notes, not estimates.** Shaded rows
  with the raw value recorded: 4 of 5 the shade hurt (781d15889c87,
  abe6aeb75082, c26fb878d897, d53a9e991f6b - all "premarket/spot at or
  through the barrier, shade toward the mid for reversal"); 1 helped
  (SPY 23a99c8fe4e8). When a measured print is already at or beyond the
  barrier, est_prob is the raw touch.py value and the reversal view goes
  in the note as "shade view: X", like an inferred open (2026-09-25 rule).
  Recording rule only; touch stays forecast-only.
- **Validated-feed sweep, 10-06 retirement test already decided.** The
  test was "retire if no leg outside the Parcl set shows ask-edge >=
  min_edge". USGS '7' bucket 9a2944acc280 (Yes @0.12, own 0.16, edge
  0.04) cleared min_edge outside Parcl, so the sweep continues past
  10-06. Being at the floor exactly, it is one marginal leg, so the
  10-06 deep retro should still say whether the sweep produced anything
  beyond it. Parcl's October set was not listed on gamma at 00:25Z. If it
  appears, the zero-crossing rule and the $10 family cap apply as
  written.
- **BanRep Sep ladder, tails over-weighted (RETRO-20260930-2215).** 3 of
  4 legs lost to the market, with mass on hold and 50+bp and too little
  on the modal 25bp. That is one event. No rule; record it and look for
  a second central-bank ladder with the same shape before acting.
- **USGS daily-max ladder, in-progress Poisson: first settled event
  (RETRO-20261001-2015).** Sep 30 ladder (c7cceb5a2381, 603ce1291e65,
  e879bdcdfa8c, 1150efff6222): observed max 5.6 with 3.7h left, 365d
  USGS exceedance rates -> 0.88/0.045/0.033/0.04; max held at 5.5-5.6.
  4/4 legs beat the mid, -0.0242 combined. Edges were 0.02-0.03, under
  min_edge, correctly skipped. One event: keep using the method for
  forecasts; no betting change until a second settled ladder agrees.
- **Empty-book forecast rows are excluded from edge claims
  (RETRO-20261001-2015).** Yen intervention cbcbeb568399 scored -0.131
  vs a 0.375 "mid" that was bid 0.01 / ask 0.74 on $11 liquidity. That
  dBrier measures a junk mid, not calibration. When recording a forecast
  whose spread is >= 0.5, say "empty book" in the note; retros and deep
  retros drop such rows from any category or edge-class "agent beats
  market" claim (report them separately if at all).

## DEEP-2026-10-02 rulings

- **Pacing jitter, not avoidance.** 4 intended FULLs became LIGHT in 24h
  because next_full_cycle_after was set to exactly :15/:30 and the tick
  arrived 3-7 min early (06:23Z, 12:26Z, 00:12Z, 04:11Z). FULLs fell to
  about 6h apart, 4 per 24h, while the cloud runner left 75 of 150
  screener batches unspent on 2026-10-01. The fix is in schedule.json
  `screener_budget`: set the next FULL to the previous FULL tick's start
  time + 1h45m.
- **Watch items for settled events move to strategy/watch-archive.jsonl.**
  schedule.json was 70KB and is read on every tick. 13 items whose
  referenced ids had all settled were archived (it is now 46KB). Rule is
  in `watch_items_comment`.
- **Consensus-centred econ ladders: the tails are too fat, 2 events.**
  BanRep Sep (DEEP-2026-10-01: 3 of 4 legs lost to a modal 25bp book) and
  ISM Mfg Sep (86611533be34 and siblings, N(55.0, sd 1.3) vs a book with
  54.x+55.x at ~0.76 against the model's 0.56; net +0.130 dBrier over 5
  rows, RETRO-20261001-1615). In both, the book's modal concentration
  beat a sd chosen by convention. Two events is **insufficient data** to
  ban anything. Pre-registered: (1) from now on, a ladder note states
  where its sd came from (a historical consensus-miss series for that
  release, with source, or "convention"). (2) If a third
  consensus-centred ladder loses to the book's modal pair while using a
  conventional sd, tail-leg BETS (legs outside the book's top two
  brackets) on such ladders become forecast-only until a sourced-sd
  ladder settles agent-closer. CPI/PPI single-threshold rows (the
  validated mechanical-econ family) are not affected.
- **Say-the-word Yes-side base-rate gate: 1W/0L.** Peterbilt
  'Manufacturing' 50d06b8745c2 won (+$1.10). n=1, no change. The
  lifetime 0W/4L Yes-side record still predates the gate.
- **Outside-view-veto held where it mattered.** Saint-Martin 76946f6b4f07
  (own 0.38 from one H2H vs a deep book at 0.775; Saint-Martin won,
  dBrier +0.334) was the day's worst forecast, and the veto kept the
  No-side trade off the ledger. On the lifetime score.py dedup the OVV
  bucket is n=157, dBrier +0.042, so the veto stays.

**Unexplained-move tracking (paired with the 2026-09-21 Opus case,
RETRO-20260922-0619): 1-for-2 so far, not a rule either way.** This
market's book moved 0.255->0.535 between Sep27 and Sep29 with, per the
row's note, "no source I can find." Per the Sep21 lesson ("a price move
with no sourced cause is not itself evidence") the estimate was NOT
revised toward the market (held at 0.30 vs market 0.535) and the bet was
vetoed. This time the market was right — event resolved Yes, own's
whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions search method never surfaced whatever
the book saw. Sep21's case had the opposite result: an unsourced jump
that reversed, where discounting it was correct. Two data points, one
each way, on the specific question "should an unexplained price move
against a public-record-search estimate shift the estimate itself
(separately from whether it should ever be traded)." Full grading in
RETRO-20260929-2342. Stays a tracked observation, not a playbook rule —
n=2 is far below the ~15-settlement floor CYCLE.md sets for acting on a
read, and the two cases are in different categories (ai-model-release vs
news). Re-visit if a third instance settles either way.

## 2026-09-30 15:45Z update: Core PCE Aug, Parcl Sep30 SET, AAA gas $4.50 settled (RETRO-20260930-1545)

Parcl SF f9d58ef036d0 +0.85; 1a0bd265abba refused). Ruling: no boundary
change.

- **Econ ladders in annual-revision months: the tracker spread is not
  the uncertainty (n=1, Core PCE Aug 2026).** BEA printed core 3.0% YoY.
  The trackers were GS 3.16, Fed staff "about 3.2" and BofA/Cleveland 3.4.
  Every one missed by 0.2pp or more, because the annual revisions landed
  in the same release. When a release carries annual or comprehensive
  revisions, use a YoY sigma of at least 0.2pp. Cap any single
  bracket-Yes estimate at 0.40. The 3.3 No bet won, but only because
  3.3 sat between two wrong camps. Grade it as a lucky thesis.
- **Parcl home-value family passes its Sep30 pre-registration.** 3/3
  bets won (+$1.37) and 15 legs moved the right way (mean dBrier -0.0085).
  October legs may be bet, within the $10 first-contact family cap and
  one thesis per event. This is one correlated draw on one data source.
  Any zero-crossing loss still moves the family to forecast-only.
- **Touch-by-deadline trend reads must price a plateau (AAA gas $4.50,
  Sep 2026).** Own 0.85 and 0.94 on a 2c/day climb from $4.44-4.48. The
  price flattened at about $4.48 and never touched $4.50. Neither row
  note put any probability on a stall. A touch-Yes estimate built on
  trend continuation must state P(trend stalls before the threshold),
  and that P is at least 0.25 unless a sourced driver (a scheduled
  event or a futures curve) says otherwise. The family stays
  forecast-only.

## 2026-09-30 18:57Z update: two `outside-view-veto` rows settled (Alibaba best Chinese AI model, Musk 40-64 tweets) (RETRO-20260930-1857)

| Alibaba best Chinese AI model (`f41e0b09f084`, OVV, supersedes `1e0944b4f952`) | 0.65 / 0.935 | No | +0.29 | No | **+66.43** |
| Musk 40-64 tweets Sep28-30 (`16af5b16fa0c`, OVV) | 0.85 / 0.675 | Yes | +0.18 | Yes | **+2.35** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
outside-view-veto`): 186 rows, 76W/102L, +$134.99 (was +$66.20;
66.20+66.43+2.35=134.98, rounding ✓), dBrier +0.0311 (was +0.0343). Side:
no +$102.10 (35.67+66.43=102.10 ✓); yes +$32.88 (30.53+2.35=32.88 ✓).
Ruling: no boundary change — both are single new rows in already-populated
groups (ai-leaderboard n=1 event overall; countable-metric carve-out bar
still not met per RETRO-20260930-1857). The Alibaba row is notable because
it is the first settlement in the "fading a >0.90 consensus" family (July
twin losses, RETRO-20260731-1912/2211) to go the other way — the declined
No bet would have won big instead of losing — but n is still 1 for this
exact market and far below the ~15-settlement floor for acting on it.

## 2026-09-30 20:1xZ: valid-vote thresholds need valid-vote poll shares (FULL cycle, operator machine)

Forecast 4e52c227a60f (Flavio Bolsonaro >=39% of the VALID vote, Brazil
first round) put the mean at 37.6 from RAW poll shares and got 0.45. Brazilian
polls report shares of all respondents, including 6-15% blank, null and
undecided. The resolver divides by valid votes only. Converted, the same
pollsters sit at 38-44 (mean ~40), and the row is now e6afa32bb249 at 0.84.
Rule: when a market's threshold is a share of valid votes (or of votes cast
for candidates), convert each poll with share / (100 - blank - null -
undecided) before comparing, and state the conversion in the note. Swedish
and German polls already publish party shares on a valid-vote basis; most
Latin American pollsters do not. Grade at the Oct 4 settlement: the raw row
and the converted row sit on opposite sides of the mid (0.88), so the outcome
scores the method error directly.

## 2026-09-30 22:10Z update: five veto rows settled (Treasury touch ladder, Sep29 quake daily-max) (RETRO-20260930-2210)

| Row | own / mkt | Side | Edge | Outcome | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30y dip < 5.21 Sept (`3e4351bdb5c6`, OVV) | 0.30 / 0.12 | Yes | +0.17 | No | **-5.00** |

| 5y hit 5.07 Sept (`ce469c824b68`, WSV) | 0.44 / 0.63 | No | +0.02 | Yes | **-5.00** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
outside-view-veto`): 188 rows, 76W/104L, +$124.99 (was +$134.99;
134.99-5.00-5.00=124.99 ✓), dBrier +0.0319 (was +0.0311). Side: no
+$102.10 (unchanged ✓); yes +$22.88 (32.88-10.00 ✓). Wide-spread-veto: 36
rows, 17W/13L, -$35.23 (-32.08+1.85-5.00=-35.23 ✓). Ruling: no boundary
change. Both OVV rows were Yes-side bets on a reversal or a quiet tail,
and both vetoes saved $5.

**The ledger's countable-metric "MET" verdict is a labelling artefact, not
an activation.** The tool's retro-prose labeller tagged the Alibaba
best-Chinese-model row as countable-metric because a neighbouring section
heading in RETRO-20260930-1857 sat within its 600-character window. That
row alone brings +$66.43 and dBrier -0.45. Corrected by hand (drop Alibaba,
add the quake 5.3-5.4 row): 5 rows, 4 events, 3W/2L, +$20.57, mean dBrier
-0.077. One event (GTA VI views, 2 rows, market 3962583) supplies +$28.22
and all of the negative dBrier; the other 3 events are 1W/2L, -$7.65. The
carve-out stays inactive until the bar is met without a single event
carrying it AND the labeller no longer depends on retro layout (proposal
"subclass auto-tagger"). Retros that grade a countable-metric row must
keep other veto ids more than 600 characters away from the sub-class name,
or name the other rows' sub-class explicitly next to their ids.

## 2026-09-30 23:16Z update: Silver LOW $60 miss — an inferred cross-feed breach is not a measured input (RETRO-20260930-2316)

`ef278b9158f5` (commodities-touch, forecast-only): `touch.py` on measured
CBOE VXSLV vol put the barrier at 0.71. The row then added +0.1 because a
Kitco bid quote (59.98, a different venue) sat below the $60 barrier ~4h
before close, reasoning the market's actual resolution feed (Pyth XAGUSD)
"already printed <=60" and the market (mid 0.55-0.58) hadn't caught up
yet. Outcome: No — Pyth's spot never touched $60; own brier 0.5184 vs
market 0.3025 (+0.2159, the worst row in the family this batch).
`commodities-touch` is n=16 now (crossed the ~15 floor), aggregate
brier_delta -0.0301 (still net ahead of market), so no gate change, but
the failure shape is a repeat of the 2026-09-25 rule ("an inferred open is
not a measured input", PLTR `a468e40297ae`): a plausible cross-source
inference got written into `est_prob` instead of staying a note caveat.

**Rule:** a touch estimate may claim a barrier has already been breached
only on the market's own named resolution feed (or a feed the market's
rules explicitly treat as equivalent) — never a different venue's bid/ask
or a headline that doesn't name the resolution source. Any such read goes
in the note as a caveat only, never added to `est_prob`.

## 2026-10-01 08:3xZ update: NVIDIA backfill + four outside-view-veto rows + one wide-spread-veto row settled (LIGHT tick, RETRO-20261001-0836)

**Backfill:** `ce1f37ed95c0` NVIDIA-largest-company settled 2026-09-30
22:05Z and was graded narratively in RETRO-20260930-2316, but the
same-commit table duty (DEEP-2026-08-23) was missed. Entered here
alongside this tick's own batch.

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA largest co (`ce1f37ed95c0`, OVV, backfill) | 0.78/0.914 | No | +0.134 | Yes | **-5.00** |

| Machado enters Venezuela (`53ea2024db78`, WSV) | 0.12/0.225 | No | +0.070 | No | **+1.17** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
outside-view-veto`): 193 rows, 78W/107L, +$111.48 (was
188/76W-104L/+124.99; 124.99-5.00+0.68+0.81-5.00-5.00=111.48 check), dBrier

102.10-5.00+0.68+0.81=98.59≈98.60 check); Yes +$12.88 (was +$22.88,
22.88-5.00-5.00=12.88 check). Wide-spread-veto: 37 rows, 18W/13L, -$34.06
(was 36/17W-13L/-35.23; -35.23+1.17=-34.06 check), dBrier -0.0011.

Ruling: no boundary change. Both Millennium-solution sibling markets
(OpenAI-specific and AI-lab-general) resolved No as the base-rate read
expected. NVIDIA's single loss is a reminder that a 0.78 own-estimate is
not automatically safe once the market has moved to 0.914: the realizable
edge flips to the side the recorded outcome label doesn't name.
`core/counterfactual.py reconcile` also surfaced 14 further pre-2026-10-01
outside-view-veto rows graded narratively in their retros but never
entered as table rows here (a formatting debt, not a new loss), plus a
parser-reported mismatch against this table's own last stated running
total. Logged in `journal/proposals.md` for a dedicated backfill pass
rather than hand-fixed piecemeal here.

## 2026-10-01 09:39Z update: one outside-view-veto row settled (FULL tick, RETRO-20261001-0939)

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NK exactly 2 tests Sep (`71aef6acf4eb`, OVV) | 0.47/0.32 | Yes | +0.140 | Yes | **+10.15** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
outside-view-veto`): 194 rows, 79W/107L, +$121.63 (was
193/78W-107L/+111.48; 111.48+10.15=121.63 check), dBrier +0.0316 (was
+0.0327). Side split: No +$98.60 (unchanged); Yes +$23.03 (was +$12.88,
12.88+10.15=23.03 check).

Ruling: no boundary change. The NK count family (4+, exactly 3, exactly
2) landed own-closer on all three legs, but it is one draw on a
first-use Poisson rate; the count model stays `unvalidated-method`
until it grades on at least five independent months or families.

## 2026-10-01 19:18Z update: one wide-spread-veto row settled + one backfill (FULL tick, RETRO-20261001-1918)

**Backfill:** `a7a4bdb5c92f` Iran Sanctions EO settled on the 11:51Z
LIGHT tick and was graded narratively in RETRO-20261001-1151 without
the same-commit table row (DEEP-2026-08-23). Entered here.

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Iran Sanctions EO Sep30 (`a7a4bdb5c92f`, WSV, backfill) | 0.04/0.215 | No | +0.040 | No | **+0.43** |
| Kraken NPM HIGH 13B Sep30 (`cb37130b62a6`, WSV) | 0.02/0.209 | No | - | No | refused (no bid at record) |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
wide-spread-veto`): 39 rows, 32 trd, 7 refused, 19W/13L, -$33.62 (was
37/18W-13L/-34.06; -34.06+0.43=-33.63, 0.01 rounding), dBrier -0.0033
(was -0.0011). Side split (question frame): No -$28.97 over 19 trd.

Ruling: no boundary change. Both rows were thin-book spread-artifact
mids ($26 and $330 liquidity) where the veto cost little either way.

## 2026-10-01 23:36Z update: two `wide-spread-veto` rows settled, both refused (LIGHT tick, RETRO-20261001-2336)

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Biggest earthquake Sep30, 5.3-5.4 (`0112790db6f8`, WSV) | 0.01/0.079 | Yes | -0.003 | No | refused (entry 0.013, outside [0.02, 0.95]) |
| Stripe NPM LOW $155B by Sep30 (`7607dc6c9caa`, WSV) | 0.01/0.101 | No | - | No | refused (no bid at record) |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
wide-spread-veto`): 41 rows, 32 trd, 9 refused, 19W/13L, -$33.62
(unchanged -- both new rows are refused, not fillable), dBrier -0.0033
(unchanged).

Ruling: no boundary change. Both rows were unfillable (price outside the
[0.02, 0.95] band / no bid at record), so neither adds a trade to the
ledger -- the veto's cost is zero on these two by construction.

## 2026-10-02 00:41Z update: one `wide-spread-veto` row settled, fillable (FULL tick, RETRO-20261002-0041)

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trump "Made in America" at Peterbilt Oct1 (`486cacf5edf4`, WSV) | 0.85/0.53 | Yes | +0.22 | Yes | **+2.94** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason

(was -$33.62; +2.94, 0.01 rounding), dBrier -0.0080 (was -0.0033).
Side split (question frame): Yes -$1.72 over 14 trd, No -$28.97 over
19 trd.

Ruling: no boundary change. The veto lost $2.94 here, but the Yes side
is near break-even over 14 trades and the 0.85 estimate cited a
sibling phrase's hit count, not its own.

## 2026-10-02 15:45Z update: two `outside-view-veto` rows settled (Tesla Q3 deliveries) + Musk backfill (FULL tick, RETRO-20261002-1545)

**Backfill:** `a6a6ed8790b0` Musk Sep25-Oct2 200-219 tweets settled on
the 11:03Z LIGHT tick; RETRO-20261002-1103 graded it but said the table
was unchanged. Declined OVV forecasts are this table, so it is entered
here.

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Musk 200-219 tweets (`a6a6ed8790b0`, OVV, backfill) | 0.38/0.655 | No | +0.27 | No | **+9.29** |
| Tesla Q3 475k-500k (`a3ef8fda3cc9`, OVV, superseded) | 0.47/0.60 | No | +0.12 | Yes | **-5.00** |
| Tesla Q3 475k-500k (`6fa8dd2218cf`, OVV) | 0.70/0.905 | No | +0.19 | Yes | **-5.00** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason
outside-view-veto`): 197 rows, 80W/109L, +$120.92 (was
194/79W-107L/+$121.63; 121.63+9.29-10.00=120.92 check), dBrier +0.0307
(was +0.0316). Side split: No +$97.88 (was +$98.60; 98.60+9.29-10.00 =
97.89, 0.01 rounding); Yes +$23.03 (unchanged).

Ruling: no boundary change. The veto saved $10 on the two Tesla rows.

**Unexplained-move tracking, n=3 (2-for-3 market right).** The Tesla
book climbed 0.22 (Sep 28) to 0.93 (Oct 2) with no source found; actual
486,532 landed in the bracket. Tally: Opus (Sep 21, sudden jump that
reversed, discounting right), Trump renames AI (Sep 29, multi-day
climb, market right), Tesla (Oct 2, multi-day climb on a liquid book,
market right). Split to watch: sudden jump versus gradual multi-day
drift on a liquid book. Still a tracked observation, not a rule, until
it has far more settlements.

## 2026-10-02 18:57Z update: one `outside-view-veto` and one `wide-spread-veto` row settled, post-count pair graded (FULL tick, RETRO-20261002-1857)

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Musk 220-239 tweets Sep25-Oct2 (`89733920b201`, OVV) | 0.56/0.345 | Yes | +0.21 | Yes | **+9.28** |

OVV ledger: 198 rows, 81W/109L, +$130.20 (was +$120.92; 120.92+9.28),
dBrier +0.0293 (was +0.0307). Side split: Yes +$32.31, No +$97.88.
WSV ledger: 43 rows, 34 trd, 9 refused, 20W/14L, -$35.69 (was -$30.69),
dBrier -0.0050 (was -0.0080). Side split: Yes -$6.72 over 15 trd, No
-$28.97 over 19 trd. Ruling: no boundary change on either.

**Unshaded post-count bootstrap (RETRO-20260925-1812), two more
independent events.** Musk Sep25-Oct2 (all windows 0.56, won, -0.235)
and Trump Sep25-Oct2 200+ (all windows 0.414, lost, +0.069): latest
rows net -0.167 vs the mid. The rule stands. Watch item: the Trump miss
came with a visible slowdown (16 posts in the 15h before record) that
only the aligned windows (0.333, n=6) carried. If two more independent
events miss the same way, revisit "all windows when aligned n<20".

**Label slip:** `89733920b201` (Musk tweets) was recorded as
`countable-metric`; tweet counts are `social-media-postcount`.

## 2026-10-03 01:3xZ update: Parcl Dec 31 legs need same-season conditioning (FULL sweep)

The unconditioned 90-day relative-change distribution (`work/parcl_1002.py`,
all history and last 3 years) ignores Q4 seasonality. Oct 2 to Dec 31
changes were negative in each of the last four years in LA (-4.02, -0.57,
-0.53, -1.32%), Austin (-9.00, -3.37, -4.57, -3.84%) and the US index
(-5.81, -0.89, -1.41, -0.72%); only the 2020-21 boom years rose. The
unconditioned read put LA >= 1,168K at 0.39 (3y) to 0.62 (all) and my
Oct 2 forecast at 0.48; the same-season read is about 0.15, so
`890f7c29dd5f` was superseded by `75840bd021ad`. Rule: any Parcl leg with
a horizon over 30 days reads the same-calendar-window changes for each
past year (`strategy/tools/parcl_season.py <parcl ids>`) next to the
unconditioned distribution, and the estimate leans on the same-season
read. The 90-day legs stay forecast-only (`unvalidated-method`).

## Postcount late-window reads and skip labels (RETRO-20261002-1815)

- Trump TS Sep25-Oct2: the 10:18Z supersede pair (xtracker count 191,
  hourly bootstrap of the posts still needed, ~5h left) beat the mid by
  ~0.06 per leg (net -0.124 dBrier). The 08:19Z pair, same method with
  7.7h left, was +0.05. One event, so the bar stands (cell n=44, +0.0323;
  revisit bar is <= 0 at n >= 50).
- From now on a postcount note whose estimate rests on a live tracker
  count with < 8h left starts with `late-window:`, so the deep retro can
  split tracker-anchored late reads from early-week bracket guesses
  before the n=50 review.
- Both 10:18Z rows had ask-edge >= min_edge and were declined only by the
  bar but were recorded `no-edge`. Per DEEP-2026-08-15 they are
  `category-bar`. A postcount row with ask-edge >= min_edge always gets
  `category-bar`. Counterfactual for the pair: +$4.39 (correlated legs).
- **Ongoing-silence conditioning (RETRO-20261006-1815).** Musk wk
  Sep29-Oct6 finished at 207: zero posts from 11:56Z Oct5 to the 15:59Z
  close (~28h). At 23:15Z Oct5 (12h of silence already showing) the
  all-windows xtracker bootstrap still gave 220-239 0.748 / 200-219 0.081
  (6c1b45515f06 +0.187, b0e5f59c692d +0.279 vs mid, both superseded at
  12:37Z by a silence-aware 0.82 on 200-219). An unconditional sliding-
  window bootstrap treats the live gap as if it were over. Rule: when the
  current zero-post run is longer than any gap inside the bootstrap's
  source series, the all-windows bootstrap is NOT the recorded estimate -
  condition on the gap (only windows that start after a gap of comparable
  length, or an explicit P(dormant through close) component written in
  the note), and if neither has n >= 5 the row is `unvalidated-method`.
  n=1 event; re-grade at 3 silence-state events.
- **Streaming weekly-views ladders (RETRO-20261006-2215).** Netflix #1
  global show wk Sep28-Oct4 landed in 6-9M; my self-built wk3/wk2 decay
  prior (0.5-0.65 off a 14.5M wk2) gave P(>=9M) ~0.25 vs the ladder's 9-12M
  bid 0.014 (d464b1156ed9 own 0.72 / mid 0.9365, dBrier +0.074; OVV kept a
  -$5 CF off the ledger). Rule: a decay-prior estimate on a Tudum weekly
  bracket is `unvalidated-method` until the prior is back-tested on >= 3
  past Tudum weeks of the same title shape; until then the adjacent-leg
  bids are the outside view to beat. n=1.

## DEEP-2026-10-03 rulings

- **Zero-crossing legs are mechanical tail reads, not judgment estimates
  (ambiguity closed).** 3989eabf623a (Parcl NYC >= $510K Dec31, Yes @0.24,
  est 0.98, claimed edge 0.74) was placed under the Parcl Dec31 watch
  item's pre-registered rule (a). The outside-view veto (> 0.10) is
  written for judgment estimates, and the mechanical-econ carve-out caps
  econ prints at 0.20. Neither says what happens to an empirical-tail
  read with zero historical crossings. Ruling: a Parcl zero-crossing leg
  is exempt from the > 0.10 veto when ALL of these hold: (1) the market
  description names the Parcl Labs index/ID already resolver-matched (the
  5/5 NYC check) and is quoted in the rationale; (2) the required move is
  >= 1.5x the worst horizon-matched 2020-26 move (NYC: -24% needed vs
  -11.9% worst, so 2.0x); (3) the book spread is <= max_spread 0.06;
  (4) est_prob is capped at 0.98, because the residual risk is
  resolution or methodology change, not the index path; (5) the $10
  family cap holds. 3989eabf623a meets all five. I verified the gamma
  description on 2026-10-03: Parcl_ID 5372594, x1000 sq ft. Verdict:
  KEEP. The existing kill switch stands: any zero-crossing loss sends
  the family forecast-only. Other validated feeds (USGS, PortWatch) do
  NOT inherit this exemption. Each needs its own resolver-matched
  zero-crossing record first.
- **Parcl Dec31 pre-registration (b), freshly-seeded-ladder carve-out to
  max_spread: REJECTED.** Three reasons. The one leg that met the
  zero-crossing standard (NYC) already traded on a <= 0.06 book, so the
  carve-out would have bought nothing. The other 7 vetoed legs fail the
  zero-crossing test on their own merits: Chicago >= 327K needs only
  -4.2%, and SF/Dallas depend on momentum, which the agent's own
  22:3xZ re-quote correctly kept forecast-only. And Parcl has n=1 settled
  family decision (Sep 30 trio, +$1.37), too thin to loosen a hard rule.
  Re-open only if a leg meeting conditions (1), (2), (4) and (5) above
  sits on a book with spread > 0.06. Even then the most it may use is
  the existing min_edge_wide_book 0.30 floor, logged as a spread exception.
- **PortWatch weekly-sum bet 9b7c41da79ac: KEEP, one leg only until it
  settles.** It is compliant (edge 0.07, spread 0.01, $5 within the $10
  family cap, weekly-sum resolver match 2/2). The structural weakness is
  information timing. When the bet was placed, 0 of the 7 window days
  were published (the feed lags about 3 days), while a $20.8k book can
  watch live AIS. The 2026-09-30 note already flagged that the book's
  skew may carry AIS information. Until this leg settles (Oct 4-7), no
  second PortWatch leg. **Pre-registered:** if the week's sum lands >= 190,
  the direction the book skewed (210-229 priced 0.09 vs model 0.04), then
  PortWatch bets require >= 3 published in-window days. If it lands in
  170-189 or below, no restriction. Either way this is one event, so
  grade the method, not just the P&L.
  **TRIGGERED 2026-10-06 (RETRO-20261006-1615):** the week resolved
  190-209 (book-skew direction), 9b7c41da79ac lost -$5. From now on a
  PortWatch weekly-sum or MA bet needs >= 3 published in-window days in
  the feed at placement; with fewer, record forecasts only (skip label
  `feed-days-gate` when the leg clears min_edge, else `no-edge`; never a
  veto label, so the gate gets its own counterfactual slice).
  The family's first settlement is in, so the $10 first-contact cap
  lapses; the normal $10 per-event cap still applies.
- **Pacing fix confirmed.** The +1h45m target (DEEP-2026-10-02) took the
  window from 4 FULLs to 12. Every FULL committed a funnel row
  (06:22Z backfilled, 08:13Z through 04:11Z). Keep.
- **Hourly recording rules this window: all KEEP.** These are the
  resolver-read conflict rule (7a016098059f), the stale-mid rule
  (8de7ff599222 was graded at 0.725 vs a live 0.36/0.74 book, the window's
  largest dBrier +0.227 and a benchmark artefact rather than an estimation
  miss), the box-office press-centre rule (07bfb21eee33), the
  spot-through-barrier "shade view" rule, and the postcount `late-window:`
  and `category-bar` labels. Each is a recording or labelling fix with
  cited rows. None moves a betting boundary.

## DEEP-2026-10-04 rulings

- **b05a47dabf33 (Lula < 44% valid, R1 2026-10-04, $5 Yes @0.24, own
  0.33, claimed edge 0.09): DISCIPLINE VIOLATION, graded now and
  independent of tonight's result.** It breaks two written rules:
  (1) *Price-inside-the-model-range* (RETRO-20260921-0633). The note's
  own defensible inputs are mean 44.8 (all 8 final polls) or 45.5
  (big-two), and an sd in 1.5-2.5. They give P(<44) of 0.16-0.37
  (44.8: 0.30/0.345/0.37; 45.5: 0.16/0.23/0.27). With the -1.6 2022
  Lula poll overstatement the note cites but did not apply, the range
  is 0.52-0.66. The ask 0.24 sits INSIDE the range, so the "edge" is
  an input choice (`no-edge`). Forecast 5a99241c0780 also failed to
  quote a range, which the rule requires. (2) *Label consistency.* The
  Brazil family was declined `outside-view-veto` on 2026-09-21 for
  exactly this reason: "no sourced/validated SD for Brazilian
  elections". The 2026-10-04 note says the sd is "convention ... n=1
  history, not a sourced consensus-miss series". Nothing settled in
  between validated the method, so a decline on a method stays a
  decline until a settled row validates it. Recording 0.33 when the
  model's central read was 0.345 also put the claimed edge at 0.09,
  just under the 0.10 veto boundary. Boundary-hugging is not itself a
  breach, but the pattern is worth watching. **Do not count tonight's
  result as evidence either way:** a WIN does not validate the
  convention-sd Gaussian (n=1), and a LOSS is graded as a method error,
  not variance. No second leg on this event (the watch item already says
  this). Stake is within all caps ($5 of $10 event cap, spread 0.02), so
  the breach is a method breach, not a cap breach.
- **Sharpened (vote-share ladders):** a Gaussian over an election
  vote-share bracket counts as a validated method only when its sd comes
  from a final-poll-vs-result error series of at least 3 prior elections
  in that country/office (quoted with sources in the note). Anything
  less is `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only, whatever the claimed
  edge. The AfD Sachsen-Anhalt carve-out precedent (de95e5168de3) stays
  valid because its probability came from a published seat model, not
  from a self-chosen sd.
- **Hourly edits this window: all KEEP** (they are observational and
  move no betting boundary). These are the clean-feed null updates
  (RETRO-20261003-2015, RETRO-20261004-0415), the AAA-gas and HITS Encore
  counterfactual table rows, the liquid-certainty 0.05 band (3 in-band
  rows net +0.0128 dBrier, small and honest), and the "discounting
  unexplained mid moves" observation (now 2-for-3, correctly kept as an
  observation at n=3). On the BTTS self-model vs the screener's haiku
  divergence (n=1 each way): insufficient data, keep tracking.
- **Pacing count command v5** (schedule.json notes). The v4 command
  matched only the literal `(FULL cycle`. Log lines drifted to `(FULL,`
  and `| FULL`, so v4 printed 1 for the 24h to 2026-10-04T04:40Z while
  the true count was 10. That is a fail-safe undercount, but the
  guardrail was blind. v5 classifies on whichever of `FULL`/`LIGHT`
  appears first and prints 10 on the same window, which matches a hand
  count (10 FULL, 2 LIGHT, 2 TRIGGERED).

## DEEP-2026-10-05 rulings

- **No bet settled since DEEP-2026-10-04.** Totals are unchanged: n=55,
  26W, -$4.33, dBrier +0.0725, z -3.57. Two open bets are certain or
  near-certain losses, still awaiting UMA: b05a47dabf33 (Lula <44%,
  final 45.16, mid 0.01) and 9a2944acc280 (USGS '7', mid 0.03). Once
  they settle, the totals move to n=57 and about -$14.3.
- **tse_count.py (new tool, hourly 2026-10-04): KEEP, first grade
  logged.** At 64.8% of sections, the municipality-weighted projection
  gave L44.84 / F47.26. The TSE final was L45.16 / F47.03, so the error
  was -0.32 / +0.23pt. The raw count at the same moment (L42.77 /
  F49.11) was off by 2.4 / 2.1pt. This is n=1. The tool is now a
  validated *count-projection* method for Brazil only after it is
  graded on the Oct 25 runoff count too. Until then, it may inform
  forecasts but not a bet on its own.
- **Complementary-legs rule (hourly RETRO-20261005-0415): KEEP,
  sharpened.** b350adc7e95c (Lula 2nd, 0.15, +0.2063 dBrier against us)
  and 1d98/574a (Lula 1st, 0.65/0.70) summed to 0.80. Root cause: the
  paired-margin sd came from house dispersion only. That is the same
  defect as b05a47dabf33 (convention sd). One rule covers both. **Any
  election sd must include a historical final-poll-error term (DEEP-
  2026-10-04 rule), and every leg of one event must be derived from the
  same distribution.** Brazil 2026 adds a data point: final polls
  overstated the Lula-Flavio margin by about 6.9pt (Datafolha +5 →
  result -1.9). Lula's own share (45.16) landed near the poll average
  (44.8), so the miss was the right-wing share. Use this as the runoff
  prior: the poll error ran toward the right in 2022 and in 2026 (n=2,
  direction only, not a size).
  **Update RETRO-20261005-0635 (R1 margin legs settled):** with 2018
  (~+6 share), 2022 (~9pt margin) and 2026 (~6.9pt margin), it is n=3,
  same direction. Every half-weight 2026 row (574a, 1653, fd60, 67aa)
  moved the right way but not far enough. The current rows beat the mid
  by 0.19 dBrier; the September rows with no error term lost by 0.39.
  **Runoff rows apply the right-ward correction at FULL weight
  (centre ~6pt on margin, the 6-9pt spread folded into sd). Still
  `unvalidated-method`, forecast-only.**
- **USGS weekly count (dc9200183ac0, 2026-10-04 12:17Z, '7' leg 0.48 at
  "count 7"): count not reproducible.** A USGS query at the deep retro
  (Sep 28 04:00Z to Oct 5 04:00Z, M>=5.5) lists 6 events: MAR 5.5,
  Yonakuni 5.6, Tamarindo 5.6, Vilyuchinsk 5.8, Tambolaka 5.9, Volcano
  Is. 5.5 mb. The likeliest explanation is a downward revision of a
  preliminary magnitude (Banda Aceh is now 5.3 mww), because the book
  (0.45/0.48) also priced count 7 at that time. The 04:15Z retro
  reported "6" without noticing that 12:17Z had said 7. **Rule: a
  validated-feed count note must list the counted event ids or
  times+mags, so a later tick can diff them. A count that includes an
  event within 0.1 of the threshold on a preliminary `mb`/`ml`
  magnitude carries explicit revision risk (start at 0.10 per such
  event, n=1 calibration) in the probability.** The held bet was
  entered at count 2, so this did not cause the loss. Treat the loss
  as variance.
- **Funnel rows missing (discipline, record-keeping).** On 2026-10-04,
  cycles.log has 8 FULL lines but strategy/funnel.jsonl has 4 cloud
  rows. Missing: 06:35/08:18/10:17/22:24Z, all of which screened per
  their cycles.log text. 10-02 and 10-03 had 10 each. core/screen_value.py
  reads these rows, so screener-value analysis is silently thinned.
  **Every FULL and TRIGGERED cycle appends its funnel row before the
  commit. The cycle commit is not done without it.** It belongs in the
  operator funnel-weld CI proposal (proposals DEEP-2026-10-05).
- **Pacing:** budget-aware deferral rule added to schedule.json notes
  (2 screened FULLs forfeited on 10-04). See the evidence there.
- **Discovery:** unchanged. pool_total fell from 941 (10-04 12:13Z) to
  763 (10-05 02:35Z), mostly `liquid-multiday` 117 → 35. That is one
  sample, taken just after a weekend's events cleared the 50k-volume
  floor. If liquid-multiday stays below 60 on 3 consecutive weekday
  FULLs, a deep retro should test lowering volume_num_min. Insufficient
  data today.

## RETRO-20261005-2015 ruling

- **USGS preliminary-magnitude revision risk applies to daily-max
  ladders too, and is larger than 0.10 per event (n=2).** The Oct 4
  daily-max forecast `4ea5508aaf4c` (5.5-5.6 Yes 0.90, book 0.91/0.93)
  rested on one event: Volcano Is. 11:12Z, M5.5 **mb**. USGS later
  revised it to M5.1, so the max became 5.1 and "under 5.3" won.
  dBrier -0.036 (the book was just as wrong). This is the second
  preliminary near-threshold magnitude revised DOWN in a week, after
  the Banda Aceh event (now 5.3 mww) in the DEEP-2026-10-05 count note.
  Both revisions went down, by 0.2 or more. The same Volcano Is.
  downgrade drops the Sep 28-Oct 4 weekly count from 6 to 5. That
  changes nothing for `9a2944acc280` ('7', already an expected loss).
  **Rule: when a ladder or count outcome depends on an event whose
  magnitude is still a preliminary `mb`/`ml` (not `mww`), and the
  bucket boundary is within 0.3 of it, give at least 0.20 per such
  event to the outcome where it is revised away. The 0.10 in the
  DEEP-2026-10-05 count rule is raised to match. Check `magType` in
  the USGS CSV and write it in the note.** Calibration stays thin
  (n=2 downgrades, plus 0 observed upgrades). The next deep retro
  should sample a week of M5.3-5.7 mb events to estimate the real
  revision rate.

## 2026-10-06 04:15Z update: Nebraska rally say-the-word set + Grenada settled (FULL tick, RETRO-20261006-0415)

| Row | own/mkt | Side | Edge | Result | CF pnl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Grenada win v Bonaire (`321fa9da9ea9`, OVV) | 0.60/0.695 | No | +0.090 | No | **+11.13** |

| Trump NE "Independent" 20:19Z (`4e4a0c06f526`, WSV) | 0.85/0.76 | Yes | +0.040 | Yes | **+1.17** |

Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger`): OVV 230 rows, 222
trd, 96W/126L, +$159.95, dBrier +0.0291; side split No +$143.02 (151
trd), Yes +$16.92 (71 trd). WSV 53 rows, 43 trd, 10 refused, 27W/16L,
-$15.94, dBrier -0.0171; side split No -$34.23, Yes +$18.29. These are
the tool's totals, not hand re-sums (the hand table is known to diverge,
see reconcile; the tool is authoritative).

Ruling: no boundary change. Two say-the-word method notes from this set
(evidence: RETRO-20261006-0415):

1. **Recurring-theme words: use the resolved same-word market series.**
   For a word the speaker returns to across events (Egg, Tariff, etc.),
   the series of resolved Polymarket markets for that same word at
   comparable events is the base rate of record when it is longer than
   the transcript sample. Egg: 3-transcript Laplace 0.40 lost (+0.230);
   the 6-event resolved-market series 0.74 won (-0.088).
2. **A re-record needs a new fact.** Data Center 0/3 transcripts gave
   0.35 (won, -0.326); the 20:19Z re-record moved to 0.60 at the mid
   with no new transcript or event fact and was worse. If nothing new
   was learned, do not re-record; if a re-record moves toward the mid,
   name the fact that moved it in the note.

**Pre-registered: WSV say-the-word review.** The WSV say-the-word slice
is 10 trades 9W/1L +$18.91 dBrier -0.120 (counterfactual.py by
category). Below the n~15 bar. When it reaches 15 fillable trades, the
next deep retro decides whether say-the-word rows with a speaker-only
transcript count (>= 3 transcripts) may bet past max_spread at ask-edge
>= 0.10. Kill: if dBrier on the slice turns >= 0 before n=15, drop it.

## DEEP-2026-10-06 rulings

- **Bets: n=57, 28W, -$1.98, dBrier +0.0691, z -3.48.** Nothing has
  settled since 10-04, and resolve.py reports 7 open. Since 2026-09-01
  the record is n=30, 19W (20.7 expected by our estimates, 18.3 by the
  market), +$29.69, dBrier +0.019. Two longshot wins (66131e6b8f76
  +$40.05, 09fc471ceec1 +$20.00) make up more than all of that P&L. **No
  bet edge class beats the market at a usable n.** min_edge 0.04 was
  revisited at n>=50 as pre-registered and kept (risk.json sizing_notes).
- **Zero placements since 10-04 04:18Z (about 48h; 11 cloud FULLs since 10-05, plus operator FULLs) is the
  gates working, not avoidance.** Each FULL screened 300 markets,
  escalated 15 and recorded forecasts. Every skip carries a label.
  Mechanical ledger (`core/counterfactual.py ledger`), all declined rows:
  1,233 fillable trades, +$265, dBrier +0.0055. That is at market. Its
  positive P&L comes from longshots, not calibration.
- **OVV relaxation fork: NOT MET (21st).** 230 rows, 155 events (gate 3
  holds), fold pnl f3 +$18.30 / f4 +$50.90 (gate 2 holds). Per-fold
  dBrier by the recipe is f0 +0.005, f1 +0.055, f2 +0.029, f3 +0.050,
  f4 +0.006. The two latest folds are both positive, so gate 1 fails. f4
  is the closest to zero it has been. The veto stays.
- **The last 24h of forecasts were the best day on record, and it is
  still not a bar move.** 53 rows settled, net dBrier -1.381 (mean
  -0.026). They cluster in about 5 events: Brazil R1, the Nebraska
  rally, Verity box office, Musk Oct 3-5, Grenada. That makes the
  effective n about 5, not 53. Vetoed rows since 09-29 (OVV, WSV,
  unvalidated, category-bar; n=51) are 29W at a median fill of 0.35, CF
  +$121. Without the top 3 rows that is +$35. Over the whole of September
  the same slice is +$189, and without the top 3 it is -$8. **The recent
  run is real, but it is short and clustered.** Re-check at DEEP-2026-10-13:
  if the veto slices' f4 dBrier is still negative with >= 25 new events,
  re-run the fork. Do not loosen anything before then.
- **say-the-word is the strongest forecast-side signal, so watch it
  first.** counterfactual.py by category: 90 rows / 68 events, dBrier
  -0.026, CF +$82, last two folds +$59 / +$42. The bet ledger is n=9,
  dBrier +0.031, -$13.75, from the pre-transcript-method era. The
  pre-registered WSV say-the-word review (n>=15 fillable trades) stays
  the only door. **Add to every say-the-word forecast note:
  `method=transcript-count(k/n)`, `method=market-series(k/n)` or
  `method=judgment`.** That lets the review isolate the method that is
  winning rather than the category.
- **The hand-kept counterfactual table is retired as a per-settlement
  duty.** This supersedes the DEEP-2026-08-23 same-commit table rule and
  the DEEP-2026-09-02 append discipline. `core/counterfactual.py` is
  authoritative (the 2026-10-06 04:15Z update already said so). The
  table section has reached 2,400+ lines, and this file grew 651 lines in
  the 10-05→10-06 window. At 527KB it is far past what a cycle can read.
  **From now on, a settled veto row goes in the retro only, with its
  `counterfactual.py ledger --rows` numbers. The playbook gets a ruling
  only when a rule changes.** `reconcile` will list new ledger rows as
  "never entered in the hand table". That is expected and is not a
  backlog. The section header stays, because reconcile parses it.
  Moving the frozen table to an archive file is an operator proposal
  (DEEP-2026-10-06).
- **Sensing audit (owed since 10-03), done.** discovery.py's four
  queries are all ranked by liquidity or volume. That makes the pool
  query-shaped, and thin multi-day markets (vol < 50k, liq < 20k, ending
  more than 36h out) are structurally invisible. The question is
  whether that hides edge. On 758 settled forecasts with
  liquidity_at_record, dBrier by liquidity bucket is: <2k +0.006±0.008
  (n=249), 2-10k -0.002±0.009, 10-20k +0.013±0.012, 20-100k
  +0.010±0.004, >100k -0.006±0.003. **No bucket shows edge, and thin
  books are not where we win.** The liquid-multiday trigger (3 weekday
  FULLs under 60) was MET on 10-05 (35/46/52/42), so I tested it. A live
  gamma pull for 168h, endDate order, gives 52 markets at
  volume_num_min 50k, 139 at 20k and 265 at 10k. The extra markets are
  mainly Musk tweet brackets, BTC/ETH, ATP/WTA, esports and
  daily-temperature markets. Those families are already reached by
  active-today/by-liquidity, are at market (crypto-touch, tennis) or
  are barred or negative (social-media-postcount, weather). **discovery.py
  unchanged.** Re-open this if a category with a negative forecast-side
  dBrier at n>=30 turns out to be mostly under the 50k floor.
- **Biggest misses (24h).** 4e52c227a60f Flávio >=39% (0.45 vs 0.85,
  Yes, +0.280) was a reasoning error: the same missing poll-error term
  that the DEEP-2026-10-05 one-distribution rule already fixes, so no
  new rule. 5b84cae6b47f Egg (+0.230) was also reasoning: a short base
  rate, already fixed by the 04:15Z market-series rule. Grenada was
  variance.
- **Price recording when the ask is null (hourly proposal 10-05
  16:53Z):** 17 of 1,687 forecast rows have no ask and record the bid as
  the market. Only 1 of the 12 market-agrees rows with a gap above 0.05
  is one of them. The impact is small, so do not cite a no-ask row as
  skill evidence.

## Seat-model rows: record the best model, not the outlier blend (RETRO-20261006-0815)

Evidence: Quebec "PQ majority" 4040588, final-day rows d68a099db34a 0.37
and 1cb77cb386fc 0.38 vs mid 0.32; result No (PQ 59, majority 63),
+0.035/+0.042 dBrier. Qc125 (39%) and 127qc (31-39%) bracketed the book;
I let Poliwave 49% and Vote-Scope 65% lift the recorded number. AfD
Thuringia (Sep 7, settled) is the other graded seat-model row, n=2.

Rule: when the book sits inside the published seat-model range, the row
is no-edge (unchanged), AND the recorded est_prob is the track-record-best
model's figure (or the mean of the two best), never a blend that pulls in
the outlier models. Re-check after the next seat-model election settles.

Scope (RETRO-20261006-1230): this applies to province/seat-total rows.
On RIDING-level rows, a single riding projection is noisier and the book
prices incumbency: Jean-Lesage QS incumbent `0b2580bbd7bf` recorded 0.65
near Qc125's 54% vs book 0.76, held (+0.065 dBrier; PQ sibling +0.025).
Do not shade below the book on one riding projection when an incumbent
holds the seat; record at or near the mid unless a second model agrees.
n=1.

Graded (RETRO-20261007-0015, all 7 Quebec riding rows now settled): net
+0.130 dBrier vs the mid. The four rows in ridings where QS was a top-two
contender all lost to the book (Jean-Lesage 0b2580bbd7bf +0.065 /
06a3d6fec317 +0.025, Hochelaga 2d634083dd78 +0.046, Saint-Henri
0cdee07f6243 +0.104; net +0.239) in BOTH directions (Qc125 under-rated
QS incumbents that held and over-rated the one that lost), so it is not
an incumbency effect; the three PQ-led rows beat it (Saint-Francois
a3314a17c247 -0.064 / 45918dc94a98 -0.012, Louis-Hebert c5b708870431
-0.033; net -0.109). Rule, replacing the incumbent-only scope above: a
single riding projection (Qc125 or similar) is not an edge source. Record
riding-level rows AT the mid unless a second independent riding model
agrees with the shade; a shade on Qc125 alone is capped at half the
Qc125-vs-mid gap. n=7 (one election), revisit at the next riding-level
election.
