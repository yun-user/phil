# Proposals to the operator

Things I cannot change myself, with the evidence for changing them. The daily
deep retro reviews this file and elevates what it agrees with; the human
operator acts. Append, never rewrite history. Format:

## <UTC date> — <one-line ask>
**Evidence:** ...
**Proposed change:** ...
**Status:** open | endorsed by deep-retro | actioned | rejected (reason)

---

## 2026-08-03 — (seed) escalate suspicious absences, don't just log them

**Evidence:** 19 consecutive cycles logged "no qualifying candidate" while the
true cause was that `core/scan.py` could not page past day 0. Every log line
was accurate; none of them said "my instrument may be truncating". The cause
was invisible from inside the loop and cost ~2 days of learning.

**Proposed change:** now implemented by the operator — `strategy/discovery.py`
(I own the queries) and this file (I can escalate). Standing rule for me: if
a structural pattern in my *inputs* looks wrong — all candidates in one bucket,
a whole source class failing, an entire category never appearing — write it
here rather than only noting the symptom in a cycle log.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-03)

---

## 2026-08-04 — restore benchmark AND event-status reachability (4th day, scope widened)

**Evidence:** 23 consecutive no-bet cycles 2026-08-03/04, every one on
benchmark failure, not thresholds (max clean devig edge seen 0.028 vs the
0.07 floor). New this window: the reachability problem covers *event status*
too — 2026-08-04 04:16Z found real bookmaker lines with plausible paper edges
on two ATP matches (Draper, Tsitsipas) but Sofascore, Flashscore, ESPN,
TennisExplorer and Olympics.com all 403 from the datacenter IP, so in-play
status could not be verified and both were correctly skipped. Tennis — the
highest-liquidity category the fixed scan now surfaces ($200k-460k books) —
is visible and priceable but structurally untradeable without a status
source.

**Proposed change:** (i) provision an odds API key (the-odds-api.com free
tier, ~500 req/mo, clean JSON for major leagues), and (ii) any one
allowlisted/keyed live-score or schedule source so match status can be
pinned. Together these unblock the two largest liquid categories in the
weekly window and finally give min_edge_book_devig (0.07) real tests.

**Status:** rejected (operator, 2026-08-04 — no odds API key or allowlisted
status source will be provisioned. Stop carrying this item day-to-day.
Strategy must work within what is reachable: WebSearch-derived multi-book
consensus where available, and market types whose benchmarks and event
status don't depend on 403-blocked sports sites — e.g. scheduled
economic/corporate releases, countable-metric markets, and
mechanically-resolving events.
**Re-open condition:** this rejection is contingent, not permanent. If deep
retros find that benchmark/status unreachability is materially blocking the
experiment despite the strategy pivot — e.g. placement rate stays well below
Phase-1 sample needs for ~a week with cycle logs attributing the misses to
unreachable benchmarks rather than thresholds or judgment — raise it as a
NEW proposal citing that evidence, and quantify what fraction of skipped
candidates the key would have unblocked)

## 2026-08-04 — Iran pair: manual UMA look is overdue

**Evidence:** `b21e42c123a1` and `d2dd24206542` are 4+ days past their
2026-07-31T23:59Z end date, `umaResolutionStatus` None throughout. Ceasefire
No marked ~0.475 and oscillating 0.355-0.545 across single days — the market
treats a thesis logged as "structurally impossible" as a coin flip, which is
resolver-process information we cannot see from gamma. DEEP-2026-08-02 e.4
set this look for ~2026-08-04; it is now due. The grading of $10 of exposure
(and whether the info-race class goes 2W/4L) turns on WHY this resolves.

**Proposed change:** human look at the UMA proposal/dispute history for both
markets; paste findings into journal/operator-notes.md.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — findings in operator-notes.md:
Iran-Gulf resolved No via normal UMA flow and is settled; ceasefire has NO
UMA proposal at all, contested ~50/50, unbounded tail)

---

## 2026-08-04 — loop.sh git hardening (carried)

**Evidence:** the 2026-07-31 silent 46h fork (orphaned local main) shape
remains possible; the 818281b merge fixed the instance, not the startup
sequence.

**Proposed change:** `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B main
origin/main` at cycle start in loop.sh.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — fetch + fast-forward-only sync
at cycle start; divergence warns instead of auto-resetting)

---

## 2026-08-04 — core/score.py: edge_class per ledger row + open-position mark-to-market (carried)

**Evidence:** class-level brier_delta (the experiment's primary question:
structural vs book-devig) is hand-assembled in every deep retro from
rationale text; open stuck positions ($10 currently marked to ~$2.9) appear
nowhere in score output, per the operator's own 2026-08-03 note.

**Proposed change:** core/place.py stamps `edge_class` on new ledger rows;
core/score.py groups brier_delta by it and adds an MTM line for open
positions past end date.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — ledger.py place now REQUIRES
--edge-class {info-race,cross-market,book-devig,other}; score.py reports
by_edge_class (old rows show as "unclassified"), a luck-adjusted
expected-wins/z line, and best-effort live MTM for open positions
(--skip-mtm to disable). CYCLE.md bet template updated. First run of the
z line over the 17 settled bets: expected wins under own estimates ~10 vs
5 actual, z=-2.61 — estimates look systematically overconfident, not
unlucky)

---

## 2026-08-04 — scheduled-trigger cycles bypass loop.sh's git sync

**Evidence:** this session was invoked directly ("Read CYCLE.md and follow
it... once") by an external scheduled trigger, not via `./loop.sh`. loop.sh
has the fetch/fast-forward-only sync at cycle start (from the 2026-08-04 "git
hardening" proposal above), but a session invoked outside loop.sh never runs
it. This session started with a stale local `origin/main` remote-tracking ref
(pointed at 033ff6e from 2026-07-30, ~50 commits and 5 days behind the real
GitHub tip at 5a024eb) and a shallow clone whose truncation boundary
(2026-08-03 10:16Z) made the true history look like two unrelated lineages
under local `git log`/`merge-base`. Verified against GitHub directly (MCP
`list_commits`) that origin's real `main` tip matched the "detached" work
exactly — no actual divergence, no lost commits — then `git fetch origin
main` + reset local `main` to match resolved it this cycle. Same recurring
class of issue as the 06:24Z/10:17Z/15:22Z/17:14Z cycle-log notes, but this
time the local-ref state was stale enough to look like real history
divergence rather than a simple fast-forward, which is what makes it worth
flagging now rather than re-silencing with another local `git checkout -B`.

**Proposed change:** either (a) point the scheduled trigger's prompt at
`./loop.sh 1` instead of raw CYCLE.md so its git-sync guard always runs, or
(b) move the sync logic (fetch + fast-forward local main to origin/main,
warn-not-reset on genuine divergence) into CYCLE.md step 0 itself so it
applies regardless of invocation path. Not something I can fix myself since
it's loop.sh/CYCLE.md/trigger-config, all operator-owned.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-04 — commit `6676f9d` added CYCLE.md
step 0 "Sync" with fetch + `checkout -B main origin/main`, commit message
explicitly cites the scheduled-trigger stale-clone class; confirmed by
deep-retro 2026-08-05)

---

## 2026-08-05 — deep-retro sessions still start on stale clones (residual of the item above)

**Evidence:** the CYCLE.md Sync step covers hourly cycle sessions, but the
daily deep-retro trigger follows its own prompt, not CYCLE.md. Today's
deep-retro session started detached at the correct tip but with local `main`
still pointing at pre-handover `033ff6e` (10 commits of dead history, no
common ancestor with origin/main under the shallow clone), and a plain
`git checkout main` + `git pull` dead-ends on "divergent branches". Recovered
in-session via `git reset --hard origin/main`, same as the hourly agents used
to do by hand.

**Proposed change:** prepend the deep-retro trigger prompt's step 1 with the
same sync line CYCLE.md now uses: `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B
main origin/main` (warn, don't reset, if local commits exist). Trigger config
is operator-owned.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-05 — deep-retro routine prompt step 1
now opens with the same fetch + fast-forward-only sync CYCLE.md uses, with
the warn-don't-reset rule on genuine divergence; takes effect from the next
04:40Z run; confirmed working by deep-retro 2026-08-06 — that session
synced cleanly at start, no stale-clone recovery needed)

---

## 2026-08-08 — reachability re-opened per the 2026-08-04 re-open condition; odds API provisioned

**Evidence (operator-initiated — the rejection's own re-open test is met):**
placement rate has been near zero for ~a week with cycle logs and deep retros
attributing the misses to unreachable benchmarks, not thresholds or judgment:
DEEP-2026-08-08 counts 15 of 35 researched candidates skipped
benchmark-unreachable in one window (vs no-edge 18, budget 2); the 2026-08-06
window measured min_edge_book_devig binding for the first time only because a
rare reachable line appeared. Meanwhile book-devig is the sole edge class with
a positive settled record post-power-devig-fix (2W/0L, brier_delta -0.0732 at
stamped n=1), so the blocked class is exactly the one the evidence favors.
Quantification the rejection asked for: an odds key would have unblocked the
benchmark-unreachable fraction directly (~43% of last window's researched
candidates), plus the tennis/status class flagged 2026-08-04.

**Change made:** `core/odds.py` (operator-owned, protected) — keyed
the-odds-api.com client: `sports` / `odds <sport>` (decimal, devig-ready) /
`scores <sport>` (event status) / `quota`. Key comes from `ODDS_API_KEY` or
`~/.config/phil/odds-api-key`, never the repo. Hard monthly budget guard at
450 of the 500 free-tier credits, spend tracked publicly in
`journal/odds-quota.json`, 10-min response cache so re-runs are free.
CYCLE.md step 5 now points at it. The agent cannot edit the guard; budget or
default complaints belong here.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-08 — key provisioning on the cloud
runner is the remaining step; until the key lands, odds.py exits with
"key not provisioned" and cycles should log that rather than scrape)

## 2026-08-08 — odds.py key provisioned but api.the-odds-api.com is EGRESS_BLOCKED from the cloud runner

**Evidence:** first cloud-runner use of `core/odds.py` after the 2026-08-08
provisioning (this cycle, 22:1x Z): `python3 core/odds.py quota` shows a
valid key state (`used_credits: 0`, no "key not provisioned" exit), but
`python3 core/odds.py sports` fails both transport paths — urllib raises
`Tunnel connection failed: 403 Forbidden`, and the curl fallback (line 104)
also fails: `curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`. Confirmed
directly: `curl -sS https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports` through the
runner's `$HTTPS_PROXY` returns the same `CONNECT tunnel failed, response
403`. This is the sandbox egress proxy rejecting the CONNECT to
`api.the-odds-api.com`, not a the-odds-api-side auth/quota rejection (which
would be a 401/422 JSON body, handled separately in `fetch()`) — same
failure shape as the documented `clevelandfed.org`/`macromicro.me` blocks in
playbook.md, just not yet on the runner's allowlist. journal/proposals.md's
2026-08-08 entry anticipated a "key not provisioned" failure mode; this is a
different one (key is fine, host is blocked) and playbook.md's new odds.py
section (this cycle's commit) will produce an incorrect "log 'odds key not
provisioned', fall back" line if an agent doesn't distinguish the two exit
paths.

**Proposed change:** add `api.the-odds-api.com` to the cloud runner's
egress allowlist (the operator's own laptop reachability is not in
question — this is specifically the cloud-runner proxy, same class of fix
as the 2026-08-05 10:53Z Kalshi/Manifold allowlist update). Until then,
`core/odds.py` is usable only from the operator's local machine; cloud
cycles should log "odds EGRESS_BLOCKED (cloud runner)" and fall back to
WebSearch, distinct from "key not provisioned".

**Status:** rejected (deep-retro 2026-08-09 — moot/transient: api.the-odds-api.com
was reachable from the cloud runner at 2026-08-09 02:12Z and served a 6-credit
sweep with zero proxy errors, with no visible operator action in between. The
block was flapping, not a standing allowlist gap. Re-file citing at least two
dated CONNECT-403 instances if it recurs, so flapping infra can be
distinguished from a stale allowlist)

---

## 2026-08-08 — Polymarket's own APIs (gamma-api, clob) are now EGRESS_BLOCKED from the cloud runner, not just api.the-odds-api.com

**Evidence:** this cycle (23:1xZ, LIGHT tick), `python3 core/resolve.py`
failed to fetch market 2937525 from `gamma-api.polymarket.com`: `<urlopen
error Tunnel connection failed: 403 Forbidden>` (settled 0 of 19 as a
result — cannot be distinguished from "nothing resolved yet" without this
note). `strategy/tools/quote.py` on the one open position's token
(d2dd24206542, US x Iran ceasefire No) failed both its urllib and curl
fallback paths against `clob.polymarket.com/book`: curl exit 56 (connect
failure). Confirmed at the proxy layer, not app-layer: `curl -sS
"$HTTPS_PROXY/__agentproxy/status"` lists both hosts in
`recentRelayFailures` at 23:13:2x-28Z: `{"kind": "connect_rejected",
"detail": "gateway answered 403 to CONNECT (policy denial or upstream
failure)", "host": "gamma-api.polymarket.com:443"}` and the same for
`clob.polymarket.com:443`. This is the identical failure shape as the
2026-08-08 odds-api entry above (proxy CONNECT 403, not an app 401/404),
but on the two hosts the whole trading loop depends on for settlement and
live-book pricing — every prior cycle today (through 22:13Z) reached both
hosts fine, so this is a new/intermittent allowlist regression, not a
standing gap. Per CYCLE.md's operational note ("if Polymarket APIs are
unreachable, write the failure to journal/cycles.log, commit and push what
is valid, and stop"), this cycle stopped after settle+monitor without
placing bets or attempting scan/research.

**Proposed change:** re-check/re-add `gamma-api.polymarket.com` and
`clob.polymarket.com` to the cloud runner's egress allowlist alongside
`api.the-odds-api.com` — these three are now all showing the same
proxy-level CONNECT-403 pattern. Since these two hosts were reachable
earlier today, also worth checking whether the allowlist is flapping
rather than statically missing an entry.

**Status:** rejected (deep-retro 2026-08-09 — moot/transient: both hosts
served every tick after 23:13Z, including full settle/monitor/quote cycles;
same evidence and same re-file condition as the odds-api entry above)

---

## 2026-08-09 — status update: 2026-08-08 egress-block entries look transient, not standing

**Evidence:** this cycle (02:12Z), `api.the-odds-api.com`, `gamma-api.polymarket.com`,
`clob.polymarket.com`, `clevelandfed.org`, and `xtracker.polymarket.com` were
all reached from the cloud runner with zero proxy errors -- no CONNECT-403s,
no urllib/curl failures. This directly contradicts the two 2026-08-08 entries
above (both reporting `gateway answered 403 to CONNECT` on these same hosts).
Doesn't prove the allowlist was fixed rather than flapping; either way, future
cycles should keep re-testing reachability each time rather than assuming a
prior block still holds (already added as a playbook.md durable note).

**Proposed change:** none needed from the operator unless the block
recurs -- closing the loop on the open items above with this observation.
If a future cycle sees the same CONNECT-403 pattern again, that would argue
for flapping/intermittent infra rather than a one-time fix, worth a look.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-09 — correct closing observation;
the durable residue is the playbook rule to re-verify reachability each cycle
rather than trusting yesterday's block. The two 2026-08-08 entries above are
closed as moot on this evidence; recurrence condition documented there)

---

## 2026-08-10 — forecast.py: revision support (supersede a stale open forecast)

**Evidence:** PLBY earnings, 2026-08-10. The 00:23Z cycle recorded forecast
(est 0.28 @ ask 0.25, claimed edge 0.03, no-edge skip). By the 04:16Z cycle
the ask had moved 0.25 → 0.19 and the cycle re-verified the situation
(confirmed a real recency signal, declined the resulting 0.14 claimed edge
per the outside-view veto) — a materially sharper read. forecast.py's
one-live-row rule ("REJECTED: already have an open forecast on this
market+outcome") means the row that will be graded at settlement is the
stale 00:23Z estimate; the current belief is unscored. The docstring already
anticipates this: "revision support is a v2 question, on evidence" — this is
the evidence. The same shape will recur on any multi-day candidate whose
price or facts move between cycles (CPI brackets over the 2 days to release,
primaries over the last polling days).

**Proposed change:** `core/forecast.py record --supersede` (or automatic
when a row for market+outcome is open): write the new row with a
`supersedes: <old_id>` link, mark the old row `superseded` (excluded from
settlement scoring), and have resolve.py grade only the latest row. Keeps
the anti-flooding intent — correlated re-records of an unchanged estimate
should still be rejected (e.g. require |Δest_prob| ≥ 0.05 or a decision
change to supersede). Optionally score superseded rows in a separate
"revised-away" slice; that would measure whether revisions actually improve
estimates, which is calibration data too.

**Workaround until then (in place, playbook §Forecast ledger):** revised
reads recorded in funnel.jsonl notes so retros can weigh the current
estimate at settlement.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-11 — the gap now has a settled
worked example: PLBY resolved No with the stale 00:23Z row (est 0.28) as
the graded row and the materially different 04:16Z read (est 0.33)
unscored. Design note from that same settlement: the revision was WORSE
than the original against the outcome, so score revised-away rows as a
separate slice rather than assuming revisions improve estimates —
"do my revisions help?" is itself an open empirical question the
mechanism should answer. Low urgency confirmed; the funnel-note
workaround held up this window)

---

## 2026-08-11 — deep-retro trigger prompt: unshallow before judging divergence

**Evidence:** today's deep-retro session started on a SHALLOW clone
(2-commit boundary) with a stale origin/main ref. `git fetch origin main`
reported a spurious "forced update"; local main vs origin/main showed NO
merge-base and 50 "local-only" vs 50 "origin-only" commits — a textbook
false divergence, indistinguishable at first glance from a real
force-push. The trigger prompt's rule ("if the histories have genuinely
diverged, warn and continue on local state — never reset") is correct for
real divergence but destructive on this artifact: continuing on local
state would have meant auditing and editing a strategy tree 3 days stale,
and pushing conclusions derived from it. `git fetch --unshallow origin`
resolved it instantly — local main was strictly behind, plain
fast-forward, no divergence at all. Same failure family as the 2026-08-04
and 2026-08-05 stale-clone proposals (both actioned), one layer deeper:
those fixed stale REFS, this is the shallow BOUNDARY manufacturing fake
history.

**Proposed change:** in the deep-retro routine prompt's step 1 (and
arguably CYCLE.md step 0 — operator's call), before any behind/diverged
determination: `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` and, if true,
`git fetch --unshallow origin` (fall back to `--depth=1000` if the remote
refuses). Only then apply the behind ⇒ checkout -B / diverged ⇒ warn
rule. Trigger prompt and CYCLE.md are operator-owned.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-13 — CYCLE.md step 0, loop.sh, and
the deep-retro trigger prompt all unshallow before any behind/diverged
determination; see operator-notes.md 2026-08-13. Confirmed working by
deep-retro 2026-08-14: first session with the guard in the prompt hit the
usual artifact — shallow clone, spurious "forced update" — and resolved it
per the guard: unshallow, plain 0-ahead/160-behind fast-forward, zero
recovery time. Prior history: endorsed 2026-08-12 after a second dated
instance; third benign instance recorded 2026-08-13)

---

## 2026-08-11 — core/score.py: forecasts by_skip_reason slice

**Evidence:** the most informative forecast split this window was
brier_delta by skip reason — no-edge n=41 at -0.0004 (at-market by
construction, as designed) vs architecture-mismatch n=2 at +0.1093 (the
market beat the naive model exactly as the skip reason predicts) vs
market-agrees n=2 at -0.0089 — and it was hand-computed in the deep
retro because score.py's forecasts section slices by category only.
Skip-reason calibration is the selection-grading the 2026-08-05 operator
mandate asked for ("did the skip reasons hold up in hindsight"), and
DEEP retros will need it every day as the disagreement rows settle
(outside-view-veto rows are the ones that grade the veto). Hand-computed
daily stats are the same failure class as the hand-asserted cycle counts
(v1-v3 lineage) — machine-computed or eventually wrong.

**Proposed change:** score.py forecasts section adds `by_skip_reason`
(same fields as by_category: n, wins, brier_agent, brier_market,
brier_delta). Nice-to-have in the same pass: `by_category` and
`by_skip_reason` both computed over settled rows only, with open-row
counts alongside, so slices can't be misread as including open rows.

**Status:** rejected (deep-retro 2026-08-12 — moot: the slice ALREADY
EXISTS. `by_skip_reason` has been in score.py's forecasts section since
operator commit a73bb92 (2026-08-09, the same commit that created the
forecast ledger), verified present in today's score run. DEEP-2026-08-11
hand-computed numbers the instrument already produced and filed this
without running/reading the tool first — same failure family as the
hand-asserted cycle counts. Lesson for future retros: before proposing an
instrument change, run the instrument and grep its source)

---

## 2026-08-13 — deep-retro status pass (no new asks)

**Open-item review, DEEP-2026-08-13:**

- **2026-08-11 unshallow-before-divergence-judgment (endorsed): third dated
  data point, benign form.** Today's deep-retro session again started on a
  shallow clone (50-commit boundary) and `git fetch origin main` again
  printed a spurious `+ 6bb2664...1a651a5 (forced update)`. No recovery time
  was burned this time only because HEAD happened to already sit at the
  origin tip — the artifact (shallow boundary + stale container-image main
  ref at 6bb2664) is still live and every hourly cycle log since 2026-08-12
  carries the same "local main ref stale at 6bb2664" recovery line. The
  endorsement stands; the guard belongs in the trigger prompt before the
  behind/diverged determination.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  unchanged priority.** No material revisions occurred this window (the one
  candidate that moved, AMAT, was correctly held as a duplicate estimate),
  so the funnel-note workaround again cost nothing. Low urgency confirmed
  for a second window.
- No new operator proposals. Nothing this window was blocked on protected
  code: the window's findings (sweep demotion, category-bar taxonomy,
  election-bar extension, recheck stop rule) were all implementable in
  strategy/ and are applied in this commit.

**Status:** informational (statuses of the two open items unchanged)

---

## 2026-08-14 — core/score.py: threshold_sweep No-side counterfactual slice

**Evidence:** the operator's 2026-08-09 note introducing the sweep said
"Only the forecasted outcome side is simulated; opposite-side
counterfactuals are a v2 question if the data argues for it." The data now
argues for it, with a settled worked example. The sweep computes edge as
`est_prob − recorded ask` on the forecasted (Yes) side, so a disagreement
where the model sits far BELOW a wide market — a No-side edge — is
excluded from every bucket. Consequence: the headline both DEEP-2026-08-13
and the risk.json notes have been carrying ("every sweep bucket negative;
zero settled instances of being right against the market") is a claim
about the Yes-side stream only. The settled No-side disagreements to date
both went the agent's way: PPI 5.3% (`5ad483698a95`, est 0.036 vs mid
0.171, No-side edge 0.097 realizable NET of the wide spread at No ask
0.867, bracket resolved No — a flat $5 bet wins +$0.77) and PPI ≥6.0%
(`4908388c9fd7`, est 0.003 vs mid 0.042 — not realizable through the
spread, correctly a non-trade, but still a settled row where the estimate
beat the market's mid). n=2 and event-correlated, worth nothing as edge
evidence yet — but the instrument should count this stream before anyone
concludes from the sweep that the disagreement pipe is uniformly bad.
RETRO-20260813-1707 separately mis-graded these two counterfactuals as
"both would have lost" (corrected in playbook, DEEP-2026-08-14): per-row
fill arithmetic in the instrument would have prevented the narrative error.

**Proposed change:** score.py threshold_sweep adds a No-side pass per
settled forecast row: complement edge = `(1 − est_prob) − (1 − best_bid_at_record)`
= `best_bid_at_record − est_prob`, i.e. buy No at `1 − best_bid`; bucket by
the same floors, report the same fields, in a parallel `threshold_sweep_no`
block (or a `side` field per bucket). Rows lacking `best_bid_at_record`
are skipped and counted. This keeps the existing Yes-side block unchanged
for continuity.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-16 — evidence strengthened a
third time: with the Musk 2-day pair settled, the No-side realizable
counterfactual stream is now 3W/3L **+0.32u** (the only positive stream in
the veto ledger) and the Yes-side stream 1W/4L −2.50u. Every conclusion
currently drawn from the sweep — including the risk.json floor-keeping
rationale — is computed over roughly half the disagreement rows, and the
excluded half is the better-performing one. The instrument gap is no
longer hypothetical; per-row hand arithmetic in deep retros is the same
manual-stats failure class score.py exists to prevent. Awaiting operator)

**Status update (deep-retro 2026-08-19): stays endorsed, but the evidence
basis shifts from edge to instrument.** Honest correction: the No-side
stream is no longer positive once correctly summed over all 20 realizable
rows — the 18:16Z 2026-08-18 retro updated the ledger totals (20 trades,
8W/12L, −5.42u) but carried the 17-trade side split forward unchanged, so
the "+0.92u, only positive stream" claim cited here and in DEEP-2026-08-18
was stale the moment the HD earnings (No, −1.00) and Musk weekly fork
(180-199 Yes −1.00, 220-239 No +0.16) rows settled. True split:
**Yes-side 1W/7L −5.50u; No-side 7W/5L +0.08u** — flat, not solidly
positive. That WEAKENS the edge motivation for this slice and the retro
says so plainly. But it is also the SECOND hand-arithmetic failure on this
exact quantity in two days (after the +0.17u→+0.92u correction of
2026-08-18 01:12Z), which is the strongest form of the instrument
argument: a machine-computed No-side slice cannot go stale. Endorsement
stands on that basis; the "excluded half is the better-performing one"
sentence above should now read "the excluded half is the flat one, vs a
clearly negative included half — still a materially different picture
than the sweep reports." Awaiting operator.

## 2026-08-14 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-11 unshallow-before-divergence-judgment → actioned & confirmed**
  (status updated above: operator actioned 2026-08-13; first live deep-retro
  test today worked exactly as specified).
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  unchanged priority.** Third consecutive window with zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround; no material revision occurred this window.
- New proposal above (No-side sweep slice). Everything else this window
  was implementable in strategy/ and is applied in this commit (taxonomy
  split, counterfactual correction, watch_items carrier in schedule.json,
  fat-tail and UK-GDP gradings).

---

## 2026-08-15 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (open): stays open, evidence
  UPDATED — honesty cuts both ways.** DEEP-2026-08-15 completed the veto
  counterfactual ledger (per-row fill arithmetic over all 11 settled
  outside-view-veto rows, playbook table): 5 of the 9 realizable
  disagreement counterfactuals were No-side trades the sweep cannot see —
  including BOTH wins (PPI 5.3% +0.15u, Musk 160-179 +0.61u) and three
  losses (Nordone, Flanagan, Musk 180-199). Corrected framing for this
  proposal: the No-side stream is 2W/3L, −1.24u — materially less bad than
  the Yes-side stream (0W/4L, −4.0u) but NOT positive; the earlier "both
  settled No-side rows went the agent's way" motivation (n=2, PPI-only) is
  superseded. The instrument ask is unchanged and still justified: the
  sweep currently counts only the Yes-side stream, so any conclusion drawn
  from it about "disagreement rows" covers roughly half of them. Awaiting
  operator.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  unchanged priority.** Fourth consecutive window with zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround; no material revision occurred.
- **No new operator proposals.** Nothing this window was blocked on
  protected code. Informational, with a re-file condition: no routine
  ticks fired between 2026-08-14 10:33Z and 17:23Z (~6 missed hourly
  firings — scheduler/infra side, the agent's pacing file did not defer
  them). Single instance; if a second multi-hour tick gap appears, a
  proposal should cite both dates.

**Status:** informational (No-side sweep evidence updated in place above)

## 2026-08-16 — core/forecast.py: guard against inverted-outcome records

**Evidence:** `fe954ed9f325` (Canada GDP MoM "<0.0%", 2026-08-15 17:12Z
cycle). The agent intended "P(Yes)=0.11, matching the market's own 0.107"
but passed `--outcome "No"` with `--est-prob 0.11` — the immutable row now
asserts P(No)=0.11 ⇒ P(Yes)=0.89, a ~0.78 disagreement with the market in
the exact opposite direction of the researched belief. The hourly agent
caught and documented it same-cycle (playbook §operational trap
2026-08-15), and the deep retro has added a watch item excluding the row
from calibration claims at its ~Aug 28 settlement — but the row will still
pollute `by_skip_reason`/`by_category` machine slices forever, and the
failure mode (outcome string vs est_prob referent mismatch) is silent at
record time despite the tool printing everything needed to catch it.

**Proposed change:** `forecast.py record` computes
`|est_prob − market_prob_at_record|` for the named outcome and, when it
exceeds a threshold (0.50 catches only inversions; 0.40 adds margin),
refuses to record unless an explicit `--confirm-extreme` flag is passed.
Genuine extreme disagreements are rare and deliberate (the veto class), so
the flag costs one keystroke exactly when the agent should be pausing
anyway; inversion typos get caught at the only moment they are fixable.
Optionally also: a `voided` status core could stamp on operator request for
rows demonstrated to be recording errors, so machine slices stay clean —
weaker alternative to full revision support (2026-08-10 proposal), which
this complements but does not replace.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-17 — no new instance this window
(the recording discipline held), but the graded cost of the existing
instance is now booked: fe954ed9f325 will pollute machine slices at its
~Aug 28 settlement and every retro touching Canada GDP must carry a manual
exclusion forever. A one-flag guard at record time is cheap; the failure
mode is silent exactly when it happens. Awaiting operator)

---

## 2026-08-17 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  evidence updated a fourth time.** Japan GDP d684f9caff81 settled as
  another realizable No-side win (+0.85u at recorded bid): the No-side
  counterfactual stream is now 4W/3L **+1.17u** — the veto ledger's only
  positive stream and still invisible to the sweep. Every sweep-derived
  floor argument continues to reason over roughly half the disagreement
  rows, and the excluded half keeps winning. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed.**
  Sixth consecutive window at zero cost from the funnel-note workaround
  (no material revision occurred this window).
- **2026-08-16 inverted-outcome guard → endorsed today** (see updated
  Status above).
- No new operator asks. Nothing this window was blocked on protected code:
  the window's findings (carrier checklist, mechanical-econ fork,
  exploration prioritization) were all implementable in strategy/ and are
  applied in this commit.

## 2026-08-17 07:45Z — git push silently no-ops when HEAD is detached, unpushed history nearly lost

**Finding:** this cycle started with HEAD detached at `f929a5c`, 34 commits
ahead of the local `main` ref, which was itself equal to `origin/main`
(`ec3eebc`). This is superficially the "recurring container-image artifact"
every prior cycle log has logged and fixed (stale local `main`, detached
HEAD) — but in every one of those prior instances, `origin/main` already
matched the detached HEAD tip (push had succeeded; only the local branch
pointer was stale). This time it didn't: `origin/main` was ~8 hours and 34
commits behind HEAD. The likely mechanism: CYCLE.md step 9 runs
`git push origin main` unconditionally. When HEAD is detached, `git push
origin main` pushes the *local branch ref* `main` (unchanged, still at its
old commit) to the remote — it does NOT push the detached HEAD's commits,
and it prints success/no-op, not an error. So every cycle since whenever
this started was quietly failing to publish its work, while its own sync
step's "no divergence, no data loss" reasoning (comparing origin/main to
the *stale local main*, which matched) never caught it, because both sides
of that comparison were equally stale.

**Recovered this cycle**, no data lost: verified `origin/main` (`ec3eebc`)
was a strict ancestor of detached HEAD (`f929a5c`), then
`git branch -f main HEAD && git checkout main && git push` — a pure
fast-forward, not a rewrite. All 34 commits are now on `origin/main`.

**Risk:** the recovery worked only because the container happened to
persist across all those cycles. This environment's containers are
reclaimed after inactivity — had that happened mid-streak, everything
after `ec3eebc` (retros, playbook edits, forecasts, cycle logs) would have
been unrecoverable, since none of it ever reached the remote.

**Proposed change (loop.sh, operator-owned, not mine to edit):** before
running the cycle prompt, ensure HEAD is attached to `main` — e.g.
`git symbolic-ref -q HEAD >/dev/null || git checkout -B main HEAD` — so a
plain `git push origin main` always pushes what was actually committed.
Alternatively/additionally, CYCLE.md step 9 could `git rev-parse HEAD` and
`git rev-parse main` and refuse to treat the push as done unless they're
equal post-push, catching this class even if the detached-HEAD state
recurs for some other reason.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-18 — mechanism analysis
verified: with detached HEAD, `git push origin main` pushes the stale
branch ref and reports success, so the failure is silent by construction
and the cycle's own divergence check compares two equally stale refs.
The near-loss was 34 commits/~8h of the experiment's product, and the
recovery depended on container luck. Either half of the proposed fix —
the loop.sh HEAD-attach guard before the cycle, or a post-push
`rev-parse HEAD == rev-parse origin/main` verification in CYCLE.md step
9 — closes the data-loss window; both together are cheap. This is the
highest-priority operator ask on file. Note the pattern recurred
benignly on 2026-08-18 04:12Z — local main 3 days stale with HEAD
detached at origin's tip — so the trigger state is frequent even when
the push happens to have succeeded. Awaiting operator.)

## 2026-08-18 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op → endorsed today** (see
  updated Status above): highest-priority operator ask on file.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  evidence updated a fifth time.** No-side counterfactual stream now
  6W/4L **+0.92u** over 10 realizable rows (Oak Street and Spider-Man
  66-68m both No-side wins; Musk 2d <40 the No-side loss) — still the
  veto ledger's only positive stream, still invisible to the sweep. New
  supporting evidence for the instrument argument itself: the 01:12Z
  retro found the hand-carried No-side subtotal stale (+0.17u where the
  true row-sum was +0.92u) — the exact manual-arithmetic failure class
  a machine slice eliminates. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-16 forecast.py inverted-outcome guard (endorsed): stays
  endorsed.** No new instance across ~45 rows recorded this window; the
  booked cost of the existing instance (fe954ed9f325, manual exclusion
  forever) is unchanged. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  low urgency.** Seventh consecutive window at zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround.
- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-18: the window's findings
  (carrier-checklist compliance, funnel-line pool counts, four missing
  watch items) were all repairable in strategy/ and are applied in this
  commit.

## 2026-08-19 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  still the highest-priority operator ask on file.** Every container start
  this window again came up shallow with a detached HEAD (see the
  schedule.json reason fields, 2026-08-18/19); the hourly agent's manual
  `checkout -B main origin/main` recovery is holding, but the loop.sh
  guard remains unimplemented and the data-loss window remains open.
  Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed
  with materially corrected evidence** — see the status update on the
  entry itself. Short version: the No-side stream is 7W/5L **+0.08u**
  (flat), not +0.92u; the stale figure was a second consecutive
  hand-arithmetic failure on this quantity, which is now the proposal's
  strongest argument. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-16 forecast.py inverted-outcome guard (endorsed): stays
  endorsed.** No new instance this window (~16 rows recorded); the booked
  cost (fe954ed9f325, manual exclusion at the ~Aug 28 Canada GDP
  settlement) is unchanged. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  low urgency.** Eighth consecutive window at zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround.
- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-19: the window's findings (stale

## 2026-08-20 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  still the highest-priority operator ask on file — with one evidence
  CORRECTION.** The 2026-08-19 06:23Z cycle log claims it "recovered 50
  unpushed commits" spanning 2026-08-15T23:14Z–08-19T05:16Z. That
  magnitude is wrong and is struck from this proposal's evidence: two
  independent observations put origin/main far ahead of the claimed
  ec3eebc baseline at the time (DEEP-2026-08-19 fetched ~04:49Z and found
  origin/main ~88 ahead of it; the 05:16Z cycle's own log records
  "origin/main tip 9070888"), a remote cannot regress without a
  force-push, and `git rev-list ec3eebc..084ca12` is 90, not 50 — the
  number reconciles with nothing. Honest reading: the 05:16Z push (from a
  detached HEAD) likely did no-op, leaving at most ONE commit (084ca12)
  unpushed for ~1 hour; the 06:23Z container then judged the remote from
  a stale ref and misreported the recovery's size. What this correction
  gives back is stronger than what it removes: the trigger state recurs
  on essentially every container start, a real (small) no-op instance
  recurred, and the agent's in-cycle git self-diagnosis has now
  misjudged the remote's state twice in one morning — which is exactly
  why the guard belongs in loop.sh, BEFORE the agent runs, not in more
  in-cycle vigilance. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed**
  on the instrument argument (two documented hand-arithmetic failures on
  this exact quantity, 2026-08-18/19). No veto-class settlements this
  window; evidence unchanged.
- **2026-08-16 forecast.py inverted-outcome guard (endorsed): stays
  endorsed.** No new instance across ~15 rows recorded this window; the
  booked cost (fe954ed9f325, manual exclusion at the ~Aug 28 Canada GDP
  settlement) is unchanged and lands next week.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  low urgency.** Ninth consecutive window at zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround.
- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-20: the window's two findings
  (missing funnel line on the 18:20Z six-forecast batch; the 06:23Z log
  magnitude error) were repairable in strategy/ and journal/ — funnel
  weld rule added to the playbook, evidence corrected here.

## 2026-08-21 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  still the highest-priority operator ask on file, evidence STRENGTHENED
  with two new dated instances.** (i) 2026-08-20 20:15Z: HEAD sat at
  origin/main's tip so the cycle's equality check passed, but
  `refs/heads/main` was 136 commits behind — the cycle's work landed on
  detached HEAD and `git push origin main` was REJECTED ("pushed branch
  tip is behind its remote counterpart"), recovered in-cycle; the agent
  added a playbook guard (98324bf, `git branch -vv` +
  `merge-base --is-ancestor` before any reattach). (ii) 2026-08-20
  19:13Z: a tick judged the shallow-boundary fake divergence and ran
  `reset --hard origin/main` BEFORE unshallowing — verified safe only
  after the fact. In-cycle git self-diagnosis has now misjudged remote
  state three times in two days; the guard belongs in loop.sh, before
  the agent runs. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed**
  on the instrument argument; no veto-class settlements this window,
  evidence unchanged.
- **2026-08-16 forecast.py inverted-outcome guard (endorsed): stays
  endorsed.** No new instance (~13 rows this window); fe954ed9f325's
  manual-exclusion cost lands at the ~Aug 28 Canada GDP settlement —
  next week.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  low urgency.** Tenth consecutive window at zero cost from the

- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-21: the window's findings (two
  funnel-weld violations, clean-feed cap granularity loophole,
  brier_delta sign drift in three retros) were all repairable in
  strategy/ — reconcile.py tool, three backfilled funnel lines, and two
  playbook rules, applied in this commit.

## 2026-08-22 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  still the highest-priority operator ask on file.** The trigger state
  (shallow clone + detached HEAD + stale local main) recurred on
  essentially every container start this window (22:21Z, 23:24Z, 04:16Z
  cycle logs all record it); every recovery was clean via the 98324bf
  playbook guard (`merge-base --is-ancestor` before reattach), no new
  data-loss or misjudgment instance. The guard still belongs in loop.sh,
  before the agent runs — a per-cycle manual recovery that has failed
  three separate times historically is not a fix. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  urgency DOWNGRADED — the edge motivation is dead.** The Aug14-21 Musk
  weekly legs settled 18:11Z and flipped the No-side counterfactual
  stream negative for the first time: 7W/6L, −0.92u over 13 realizable
  rows (deep-retro re-verified row-by-row today). The slice would now be
  instrumenting a net-negative stream on both sides (Yes 1W/8L −6.50u).
  The instrument argument (machine slice vs hand-summed subtotals; two
  documented hand-arithmetic failures) remains valid but is weakening:
  the last two hand-sums (18:15Z retro and today's independent
  verification) were both correct. Keep on file, rank below the git
  guard and the inverted-outcome guard. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-16 forecast.py inverted-outcome guard (endorsed): stays
  endorsed.** No new instance (~16 rows recorded this window);
  fe954ed9f325's manual-exclusion cost lands at the ~Aug 28 Canada GDP
  settlement — next week; the deep retros of Aug 28/29 must carry the
  exclusion when grading that cluster. Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): stays endorsed,
  low urgency.** Eleventh consecutive window at zero cost from the
  funnel-note workaround.
- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-22: the window's findings (weld
  violation #6 with successful mechanical detection, weekly-cap
  gate-ordering slip, Musk generation classification, cross-market
  sensing gap) were all addressable in strategy/ — three playbook rules
  and one classification ruling, applied in this commit.

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op (endorsed): stays endorsed,

  recurred again on essentially every container start this window,
  including this deep-retro session itself (shallow clone, local main ref
  6 commits behind origin, HEAD detached at the true tip — resolved per
  the trigger-prompt guard, plain fast-forward). All recoveries clean via
  the 98324bf playbook guard; no new data-loss instance. A per-cycle

  Awaiting operator.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice (endorsed, downgraded):

  correctly held as unchanged estimates rather than re-recorded).
- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-23: the window's one finding
  (veto-ledger table left stale by the 13:14Z settlement retro) was
  repairable in strategy/ — table row added, totals re-summed, and a
  same-commit table-extension rule welded into the playbook and the

- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support (endorsed): urgency UPGRADED
  from low.** New fact: the book now holds its first long-horizon
  position (de95e5168de3, AfD Sachsen-Anhalt, settles Sep 6 — 13 days
  entry-to-settlement vs ~2 days for every prior bet). The entry estimate
  (0.29 Yes, from politpro's seat model) will meet two more weeks of

- No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-24: the window's one process

## 2026-08-25 04:16Z — screener subagent output format: 47% batch failure rate

First live run of the screener tier at full 15-batch scale (work_dir
`reports/screener-work/20260825T041433Z`). `subagent_prompt_template`
(core/screen.py, protected) is explicit: step 3 says "write a JSON array"
and gives the exact top-level-array shape. 7 of 15 haiku subagents
(batches 01, 02, 06, 10, 12, 13, 15) instead wrote `{"batch_id": ...,
"scores": [...]}` — a plausible-looking but non-conforming wrapper —
despite identical instructions to the 8 that complied. `screen.py collect`
correctly rejected all 140 markets in those batches (`screen_error: "no
answer for this market in the batch out file"`), so no bad data entered
`journal/screener.jsonl` — the failure was caught, not silent. But it cost
47% of this cycle's screening coverage (160/300 collected) on the tier's
first full-scale run, and I have no lever to fix it: I pass the literal
template per CYCLE.md step 4 ("nothing else"), and the template itself is
correct and unambiguous — this reads as a haiku instruction-following
failure rate on this exact task shape, not a wording gap I can patch from
strategy/screener-prompt.md (which never reaches the output-schema part
of the prompt). Not proposing a specific fix (a stronger schema
reminder, a retry-on-malformed pass in collect, or accepting the loss
rate) — flagging the evidence for the operator to weigh, since the fix
lives in core/screen.py or the subagent invocation, both outside what I
own. Re-check the failure rate on the next few full-scale runs before
treating 47% as stable; n=1 run so far.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-25 — endorsed with one factual
correction that changes the framing: this was NOT the tier's first
full-scale run. journal/screener.jsonl holds two 300-market/15-batch runs
on 2026-08-25 — 00:19Z run: 300/300 collected, 0 errors; 04:14Z run:
160/300, 140 lost across 7 malformed batches. Day-1 record is therefore
7/30 batches failed (23%), with per-run variance of 0%→47%, not a stable
47% — the failure is intermittent, which points at output-format
instability under identical prompts rather than a deterministic template
gap. The diagnosis is otherwise verified: the 140 error rows are all
`screen_error: "no answer for this market in the batch out file"`, nothing
malformed entered the pool, and the agent has no lever — the template
lives in protected core/screen.py. Recommended operator fix, cheapest
first: (1) make `screen.py collect` unwrap the one known-shape wrapper
`{"batch_id":..., "scores":[...]}` when the inner array validates — this
recovers the entire observed failure class for a few lines of tolerant
parsing and no re-spend; (2) failing that, a retry-once-on-malformed pass
in collect (costs quota); a stronger schema reminder in the template is
the weakest option since the 00:19Z run shows the current wording can
already achieve 15/15. Keep the agent's own duty as stated: report
collected/expected in every funnel line so the rate stays measured.)
→ **actioned** (operator, 2026-08-25 ~06:35Z — the endorsed cheapest fix
shipped: `screen.py collect` now unwraps the known wrapper shape, see
operator-notes.md. Verified closed by DEEP-2026-08-26: every 300-market
run since the fix collected 300/300 except a single 299/300 (one
malformed row, correctly reported in its funnel line) — cycles.log shows
eight clean-or-near-clean runs against the pre-fix 160/300. The failure
class is closed on current evidence; per the
operator's note, any NEW wrapper variant gets escalated the same way,
never absorbed by agent-side parsing.)

## 2026-08-25 — deep-retro status pass

- **2026-08-17 07:45Z detached-HEAD push no-op: ACTIONED (operator,
  2026-08-24, commit bf0e8be).** loop.sh now reattaches main to HEAD
  before each cycle; CYCLE.md step 9 reattaches before pushing and
  verifies HEAD == origin/main after. The highest-priority ask on file
  since Aug 17 is closed. This deep-retro session still started shallow
  with a stale local main (the container-image state persists) but the
  recovery path is now code on the loop.sh side and procedure in
  CYCLE.md — no further carry needed unless a new silent no-op instance
  appears.
- **2026-08-10 forecast.py revision support: ACTIONED (operator,
  2026-08-24, commit 6b29ccd).** `record --supersede` with linked rows
  and the `revised_away` score slice — exactly the endorsed shape,
  including the "measure whether revisions help" design note from the
  PLBY worked example. First expected use: the open AfD forecast
  (f37cee91366b) if polls move before ~Sep 4-5. Zero uses so far;
  revised_away slice empty (settled 0 / open 0) — correct, no material
  revision has occurred since it shipped.
- **2026-08-16 inverted-outcome guard: ACTIONED (operator, 2026-08-24,
  commit 0980816).** `|est_prob - mid| > 0.40` now refused without
  `--confirm-extreme`. The fe954ed9f325 manual exclusion at the ~Aug 28
  Canada GDP settlement is still required (rows are immutable); the
  watch item carries it.
- **2026-08-14 No-side threshold-sweep slice: ACTIONED (operator,
  2026-08-24, commit 877a133).** `threshold_sweep_no` live in score.py;
  first-run numbers already integrated into the playbook (c3492ce). The
  two documented hand-arithmetic failures this instrument prevents are
  now moot.
- **2026-08-25 04:16Z screener output format: endorsed above** (with the
  n=2-runs correction). This is the only open operator ask on file.
- No other new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-25: the window's two
  process findings (census rows mislabeled `no-edge` — reconcile FAIL,
  fixed by relabel + playbook taxonomy addition; 04:13Z FULL cycle left
  next_full_cycle_after stale — pacing repaired, prose flag, weld only
  if repeated) were both repairable in strategy/, applied in this
  commit.

## 2026-08-25 — banned_question_patterns misses daily-resolution crypto "Up or Down" markets

**Evidence:** Today's 15-batch haiku screener run (20260825T101635Z) surfaced
two markets the screener prompt explicitly says should never reach it:
market_id 3809906 "Bitcoin Up or Down on August 25?" and 3809907 "Ethereum Up
or Down on August 25?" (strategy/screener-prompt.md's Housekeeping section:
"Sub-daily crypto up/down markets are banned upstream ... if one does, that
is a scan bug worth a line in the reason"). `config/protected.json`'s
`banned_question_patterns` is `["Up or Down - .*[0-9]:[0-9]{2}[AP]M-[0-9]",
"Up or Down.*ET$"]` — both regexes match the hourly-candle phrasing
("Up or Down - 3:00PM-4:00PM ET") but neither matches this daily phrasing
("<Asset> Up or Down on <Month> <Day>?"), so `core/scan.py`'s `keep()` lets
it through. This is the same single-token-resolution risk the existing
patterns were written to exclude (a coinflip-adjacent, reaction-speed
question, not a researchable one) — just a phrasing variant the regex
doesn't cover.

**Proposed change:** extend `banned_question_patterns` with a pattern
matching this daily crypto-direction phrasing, e.g.
`"Up or Down on [A-Z][a-z]+ [0-9]{1,2}\\??$"` (or scope it to known tickers,
`"^(Bitcoin|Ethereum) Up or Down on"`, if a broader match is judged too
aggressive) — `core/scan.py`/`config/protected.json` are protected, so I
cannot make this change myself.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-26 — verified: both existing
regexes target only the hourly-candle phrasings; "Bitcoin Up or Down on
August 25?" passes `keep()`. Same single-token-resolution/reaction-speed
class the existing patterns exclude, so the gap is an oversight, not a
policy choice. Of the two proposed regexes prefer the date-phrasing one
(`"Up or Down on [A-Z][a-z]+ [0-9]"`, unanchored) over the ticker list —
it also covers future non-BTC/ETH assets in the same daily template —
but either closes the observed gap.)

**Status update (operator, 2026-08-26): ACTIONED.** The endorsed
date-phrasing regex `"Up or Down on [A-Z][a-z]+ [0-9]"` is now the third
entry in `banned_question_patterns`. Verified against the two observed
market questions (3809906, 3809907) plus a non-BTC/ETH variant of the
same template; hourly-candle phrasings still match the original two
patterns, and non-crypto questions are unaffected. `core/validate.py`
passes.

## 2026-08-26 — watch.py new_market fired well under its own liquidity floor

**Evidence:** TRIGGERED cycle 01:22:26Z fired on `newmarket:3894452` ("HOU@NYY
O/U 12.5"). `strategy/watchlist.json`'s `new_market.min_liquidity` is 5000,
and `core/watch.py`'s `check_new_markets()` filters on gamma's
`liquidityNum` before firing — but when I fetched the same market's gamma
record moments later it read `"liquidityNum": 7.5597`, three orders of
magnitude under the floor. The market is a live in-game MLB total on a game
already in the bottom 7th (5-5, verified via MLB Stats API linescore) — the
CLOB book itself carries real depth (bid/ask sizes ~9000+ each side, spread
0.04), so the market is tradable; it's specifically gamma's `liquidityNum`
that doesn't reflect it. Two readings: (a) this field is transient/stale
right after a market's order book goes live (mine and watch.py's reads were
~20min apart, `enableOrderBook`+`orderMinSize` suggest a just-activated CLOB
market), so the floor check raced a field that hadn't populated yet; or (b)
`liquidityNum` measures something other than order-book depth for this
market type and never reflects it. Either way the floor is meant to keep
`new_market` from firing on thin/uninteresting listings, and it fired on
one anyway.

**Why this matters beyond one cycle:** the underlying market this happened
to surface was also a live in-progress sports game total — a repricing-race
shape my architecture can't research fast enough to trade (declined as
`architecture-mismatch`, forecast `8c7125bdfa3b`). If `liquidityNum` is
generally slow to populate right when a CLOB book activates, `new_market`
may be structurally biased toward firing on freshly-listed, still-live
sports markets specifically — the ones I'm least equipped to act on — while
its floor works as intended everywhere else. One instance isn't a pattern
yet; flagging so a second instance is recognized rather than treated as a
one-off.

**Proposed change:** `core/watch.py` is protected, so I cannot change the
liquidity source myself. Options for the operator to consider: check
`enableOrderBook`+CLOB book depth directly (already fetched via
`strategy/tools/quote.py`'s book endpoint) instead of, or in addition to,
gamma's `liquidityNum`; or add a short grace delay after `createdAt` before
trusting `liquidityNum` for freshly-listed markets.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-26 — consolidated with the
three later entries below: four fires in one session, two distinct
symptoms (this entry's liquidityNum underflow n=1; one-sided unfillable
post-listing books n=4), one shared root cause — gamma listing time is
not research-opportunity time for in-game sports totals. Cheapest fix
first: suppress or tag `new_market` fires whose gamma record carries a
`gameStartTime` already in the past (a field the watcher's fetch already
returns — no extra call, and it addresses the timing cause directly
where liquidity-source changes only address one symptom); the book-depth
liquidity check remains worth considering independently for the n=1
underflow. Until actioned the agent-side bleed is bounded: one narrow
gamma fetch + a correct decline per fire, capped at 6 fires/day.)

**Status update (operator, 2026-08-26): ACTIONED — the consolidated
`gameStartTime` suppression, covering this entry and the three below.**
`check_new_markets()` now skips any listing whose `gameStartTime` parses
and is already in the past at check time. Verified against live gamma
records for three of the four fired markets (3894452 start 23:05Z,
3894923 start 23:40Z, 3895121 start 01:40Z — all pre-fire), and that
non-sports markets carry no `gameStartTime` and are unaffected. A
missing or unparseable field fails open (the fire still happens), so
the guard cannot silently blind the trigger. The book-depth liquidity
check for the n=1 `liquidityNum` underflow is NOT included — it stays
open as a separate consideration if a post-fix instance recurs.

## 2026-08-26 — second `new_market` fire on an already-decided in-game total, this time with a one-sided empty book (not a liquidityNum miss)

**Evidence:** TRIGGERED cycle 01:52:53Z fired on `newmarket:3894923`
("TEX@CWS O/U 16.5", resolves Over at combined runs >=17). This time
`liquidityNum` was 10087.8 — well over the 5000 floor, so the prior entry's
specific liquidityNum-underflow bug did NOT repeat. What did repeat is the
broader shape flagged there ("flagging so a second instance is recognized"):
`new_market` fired on a market for a game already live in progress, past the
point where the outcome is researchable in the pre-game sense. Here it went
further — by the time I checked MLB Stats API's linescore (top 6th, 1-2
outs), combined runs were ALREADY 17, so Over was already mechanically
decided (runs are monotonic; barring a wipe-the-game cancellation, which the
market's own rules only invoke for full-game abandonment with no makeup,
this cannot revert). True P(Over)~0.99. But the CLOB book for the Over token
had ZERO asks (bids only, up to 0.61) — nothing to buy against — while the
Under token (the near-certain loser) had asks from 0.39. `core/ledger.py`
correctly rejects this (`no asks in the book`), and even if an ask appears
on Over once the book catches up, it will almost certainly clear
`config/protected.json`'s `max_entry_price` 0.95 (a mechanically-certain
outcome reasonably prices at ~0.98-1.00), so the cap would block it too.
Both instances now share one root cause candidate: `new_market` treats a
freshly-*listed* gamma market as equivalent to a freshly-*startable*
research opportunity, but for sports segment/total markets tied to a game
already underway, "freshly listed" can mean "freshly listed after the game
— or even the whole decision — has already happened," which is a different
and mostly untradeable animal (either raced or already-resolved-but-book-
lagging). The two symptoms differ (sub-floor liquidityNum vs a one-sided
book past the outcome's decision point) but the trigger-timing cause looks
shared.

**Proposed change:** still not mine to fix (`core/watch.py`,
`config/protected.json`). Beyond the prior entry's liquidity-source options,
this instance suggests a second, independent mitigation worth considering:
for `new_market` fires specifically, a quick live-game-state check (the kind
`core/odds.py scores` already does) before firing on anything tagged as a
live sports segment/total market — either suppressing the fire or tagging it
so the agent knows to expect a repricing-race/already-decided shape rather
than spending a narrow gamma fetch discovering that live. Two instances now;
recommend treating this as a real pattern rather than waiting for a third.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-26 — see the consolidated
endorsement on the first entry above; the `gameStartTime`-in-the-past
suppression covers this instance too, and would have caught 3894923
before the fire: the game was mechanically decided pre-listing.)

## 2026-08-26 — third `new_market` fire on already-live in-game totals (2 games, 3 markets, one cycle)

**Evidence:** TRIGGERED cycle 02:23Z fired on `newmarket:3895012`,
`newmarket:3895006`, `newmarket:3895005` together — CLE@LAA O/U 10.5 and O/U
9.5 (bottom 2nd, 4-0, ~45min post-commence) and TEX@CWS O/U 20.5 (bottom
7th, 11-7=18 combined runs). Same shape as the two prior entries above: all
three markets were listed after their games were already underway, not
pre-game. This time `core/forecast.py`'s own CLOB book read makes the
untradeable part concrete rather than inferred: all three books were wide
and one-sided (3895012 bid=0.19/ask=0.99, 3895006 bid=0.14/ask=0.98,
3895005 bid=0.43/ask=0.94) — asks near 1.0 regardless of which side a quick
pace-extrapolation model favored, so even where a real edge might exist
(e.g. TEX@CWS: ~3 more runs needed over ~2.5 remaining half-innings at an
already-elevated scoring pace, est ~0.60 Over vs a stale-looking 0.29
last-trade price) the actual fillable ask (0.98) makes the trade a clear
loser. Third instance in one session; the pattern (in-game listing timing)
and now also its practical consequence (unfillable/mispriced book on the
side any live-state model would favor) look confirmed rather than
coincidental.

**Proposed change:** unchanged from the prior two entries — still not mine
to fix (`core/watch.py`, `config/protected.json`). Given three instances
now share both the timing cause and the same book-unfillability symptom,
recommend treating `new_market` fires tagged as sports segment/total
markets as a distinct category the agent should triage with a live-game-state
check before spending any research budget, rather than continuing to
rediscover the same shape live each time. Marking this the confirming third
instance per the prior entry's own recommendation.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-26 — see the consolidated
endorsement on the first entry; pattern-confirming third instance, and
the 04:16Z retro's settlement grading adds that the pace model behind
these fires is 2W/2L on the model side — no skill being left on the
table by suppressing them.)

## 2026-08-26 — fourth `new_market` fire on an already-live in-game total (same session)

**Evidence:** TRIGGERED cycle 02:41Z fired on `newmarket:3895121` (PIT@SD
O/U 4.5), listed after the game was already in the bottom of the 4th
(1 out, 0-0, MLB Stats API gamePk 823259) — same timing shape as the prior
three entries. Book-unfillability symptom repeats too: Over bid/ask
0.34/0.99, Under bid/ask 0.07/0.99, both asks pinned near 1.0 regardless of
which side the pace-extrapolation model favored (est 0.59 Over). Fourth
instance in one session (after 3894452, 3894923, and the 3895012/3895006/
3895005 triple) — adding this purely as a running tally; the pattern and
its consequence are already fully evidenced by the prior three entries and
this changes no conclusion, just the count.

**Status:** endorsed by deep-retro (2026-08-26 — running-tally entry,
folded into the consolidated endorsement on the first 2026-08-26 entry;
no separate ask.)

## 2026-08-26 — deep-retro status pass

**Evidence/summary:** six statuses moved this pass. The 2026-08-25
screener output-format proposal is closed as actioned (operator shipped
the tolerant unwrap ~06:35Z; eight subsequent runs verify the failure
class closed — 300/300 on all but one 299/300). The daily crypto
Up/Down `banned_question_patterns` gap is endorsed (verified against the
config regexes; date-phrasing variant preferred). The four `new_market`
in-game-fire entries are endorsed as ONE consolidated pattern with a
concrete cheapest fix: suppress or tag fires whose gamma
`gameStartTime` is already in the past — it addresses the shared timing
cause, would have pre-empted all four fires including the
mechanically-decided 3894923, and costs no extra API call. No new
operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-26: the window's other findings (pacing
weld → reconcile.py check 4; fact-final/info-race ledger taxonomy
split; GTA VI liquid-book grading fork) are all agent-side and applied
in the same commit.

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: the
crypto-pattern extension and the consolidated new_market fix, both
endorsed above)

## 2026-08-27 — deep-retro status pass

**Evidence/summary:** both operator asks left open by the 2026-08-26 pass
were actioned by the operator the same day and are verified closed here:
the daily crypto Up/Down `banned_question_patterns` extension (commit
0db77ca, regex verified present in config and matching the observed
3809906/3809907 phrasings) and the consolidated `new_market` in-game-fire
suppression (commit 0a13990, watch.py now skips listings whose gamma
gameStartTime is past at check time; zero in-game fires in the subsequent
window vs four the day before). No new operator asks from DEEP-2026-08-27:
the window's findings are all agent-side and applied in the same commit —
reconcile.py checks 5 (veto-settlement table duty; three prose-rule misses
on 2026-08-26 alone) and 6 (FULL-cycle funnel-line presence; the 09:24Z
line-less FULL masked its own 99-minute pacing breach), the six missing
counterfactual-table rows (Crowley, PCE MoM x3, BoK pair), and the
mechanical-econ fork tally. NOTE the fork decision lands tomorrow
(DEEP-2026-08-28/29, pre-registered): if the condition holds after Canada
GDP settles, THAT retro files an operator-visible carve-out proposal
touching real-eligibility taxonomy — flagging it a day ahead so it is not
a surprise ask.

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: none)

## 2026-08-28 ~07:15Z: real-mode session cannot push, and cannot repair branch refs (operator action needed)

Evidence, this session (operator-machine REAL-mode FULL cycle, 06:35-07:15Z):

- `git push origin main` / `git push origin HEAD:main` hung until timeout 3x
  (2-3 min each, exit 143). `git fetch` is instant, so the network is fine;
  the hang pattern matches a credential-helper prompt that a non-interactive
  session cannot answer (SSH URL fails fast with no key, so the HTTPS helper
  is the only auth path).
- Every workaround was permission-blocked in this session: env-prefixed
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git push`, `git -c credential.helper= push`,
  `git config` (even reads), `gh auth status`.
- Separately, after resolving the 06:41Z-vs-06:55Z parallel-cycle rebase, every
  ref-moving command was permission-blocked (`git rebase --continue` (editor),
  `git rebase --quit`, `git checkout`/`switch`/`branch -f`/`update-ref`), so the
  merged commit had to be created on a DETACHED HEAD and local `main` is stuck
  on the pre-rebase orphan.

State the operator must repair (see cycle log line 2026-08-28T06:55:00Z):

- The TRUE merged state is the detached-HEAD commit chain ending at the commit
  containing this proposal (parent 0ac4b09, grandparent 6b16795 = origin/main).
- Local `main` (0607fe3) is the pre-rebase orphan; its content is fully
  contained in 0ac4b09. Fix: `git checkout -B main <tip of detached chain>`
  then `git push origin main`.

Proposals:
1. Ensure the real-mode agent can push non-interactively (cached credential or
   a helper that never prompts), or have loop.sh do the push after the agent
   exits.
2. Allowlist the minimal git ref plumbing the CYCLE.md procedure itself
   requires (`checkout -B main`, `rebase --continue/--quit`), since step 0 and
   step 9 mandate exactly those commands and this session could not run them.
3. The 06:41Z/06:55Z collision shows true simultaneity beats the 20-minute
   collision guard (both runners started ~06:35Z). One instance; if it recurs,
   consider a lock or start-jitter. Logged here per the "causes get fixed in
   proposals" rule.

**Status:** actioned (operator, 2026-08-29)

1. **Push moved off the agent.** `loop.sh` now pushes after the cycle exits,
   from the operator's interactive shell where the keychain is already
   unlocked. Root cause confirmed: the credential helper is
   `!gh auth git-credential`, which reads the token from the macOS keyring;
   a keyring prompt cannot be answered inside `claude -p`, so the push hung
   while `fetch` (no credential needed on a public repo) stayed instant.
   `CYCLE.md` step 9 now stops before the push when `PHIL_PUSH_BY_LOOP` is
   set, so an unpushed commit on this machine is expected rather than a
   discrepancy to diagnose. Cloud runs are unchanged and still push
   themselves.
2. **Ref plumbing allowlisted.** `loop.sh` adds `git checkout -B main HEAD`,
   `git rebase --continue/--abort/--quit`, and the read-only
   `status`/`symbolic-ref`/`merge-base`/`rev-list` probes. The agent also
   runs with `GIT_EDITOR=true` so `rebase --continue` cannot block on an
   editor, and `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + `GIT_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/true` so any
   stray credential lookup fails fast instead of hanging.
   `Bash(git push:*)` was removed: the runner owns the push now.
3. **Collision guard** left as-is, per the proposal's own read that one
   instance does not justify a lock. Still open if it recurs.

## 2026-08-28 — deep-retro status pass (recovered session)

Read every proposal above. No open hourly-agent proposals required a
status decision this pass: the 2026-08-28 ~07:15Z push/ref-plumbing item
was actioned by the operator (2026-08-29, loop.sh owns the push, plumbing
allowlisted) — acknowledged, nothing to add; the collision-guard sub-item
stays open on its own recurrence condition. All older items carry their
existing statuses.

New, from DEEP-2026-08-28:

1. **Operator ask — .gitignore entries for cycle working files.** FULL
   cycles have been committing per-run scratch at repo root:
   `scan-stderr.txt`, `scan.stderr`, `screen-prepare.json`,
   `screen.stderr`, `subagent-template.txt` (see 0d5d51a, 0ac4b09,
   ca570d1). Deleted from the tree in the DEEP-2026-08-28 commit, but
   they will recur on the next FULL cycle unless ignored. Ask: add to
   .gitignore (operator-owned): `scan-stderr.txt`, `scan.stderr`,
   `screen-prepare.json`, `screen_prepare.json`, `screen.stderr`,
   `subagent-template.txt`, `reports/` — or, better, a `work/` prefix
   convention the cycle procedure can be pointed at later.

2. **Informational — blend re-open condition tracking.** score.py
   blend[disagreement]: w_opt 0.622, delta −0.0058, n=70. The operator's
   2026-08-25 re-open bar is n≥100 with w_opt≤0.9: the weight condition
   now clears with room, the n condition is 70/100. No ask yet; if the
   slice reaches n≥100 with w_opt still ≤0.9, that firing is the
   operator-visible re-raise the 08-25 note pre-authorized.

3. **Informational — mechanical-econ carve-out enacted** (agent-owned
   change, flagged here for operator visibility per the DEEP-2026-08-17
   pre-registration): playbook §Mechanical-econ carve-out, band
   0.10–0.20, named-reachable-benchmark gate, one bet per print,
   pre-registered kill switch (4 events / 6 bets, net≤0 or dBrier
   non-majority → full revert). Evidence and the UMich exclusion
   reasoning in DEEP-2026-08-28.md.

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: the
.gitignore entries, item 1)

## 2026-08-29 — deep-retro status pass

Read every proposal above. No new hourly-agent proposals since the last
pass; all prior statuses stand. Updates:

- **.gitignore ask (2026-08-28 item 1): still open.** No scratch files
  recurred at root this window (the cleanup held behaviorally), but the
  ignore entries remain the durable fix.
- **Blend re-open tracking (2026-08-28 item 2):** blend[disagreement]
  n=71, w_opt 0.636, delta −0.0053. One new row since yesterday; w_opt
  wiggled 0.622→0.636 (noise). n bar 71/100 — no ask, tracking continues.
- **Mechanical-econ carve-out:** zero qualifying events yet. The
  DEEP-2026-08-29 gate-2 variance clause (playbook) narrows eligibility
  ahead of the Sep 1–5 econ cluster: dispersion must be sourced like the
  mean, so the NFP set stays forecast-only unless a quoted consensus-miss
  spread is found at re-check. Agent-owned change, informational only.

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: the
.gitignore entries, unchanged)

## 2026-08-30 14:12Z — new market-construction quirk: title window ≠ resolution window on late-created touch markets

Screener escalated 3954519 "Will Bitcoin reach $80,000 August 24-30?"
(forecast 9618a7d0872d). Gamma's own slug is
`will-bitcoin-reach-80k-august-24-30-2026-from-august-28` and the
description states price action *before market creation* does not count
— this instance was created 2026-08-28T16:57Z, three days after the
title's stated window start, so the actual eligible window is
creation→endDate, not the displayed Aug24-30. This is the same species
of bug as the already-logged BoI Aug31/Sep1 rescheduled-meeting pair
(schedule.json watch items) but on a *templated recurring series*
(crypto touch-anytime brackets) rather than a one-off reschedule —
worth checking whether other touch-anytime series legs (gas, WTI, gold)
ever get re-created mid-window the same way, since a stale `startDate`
read there would silently overstate touch probability the same way it
nearly did here. No config/core change requested — this is a read-the-
description-not-just-the-title discipline note for my own research step,
now written up so it isn't re-discovered from scratch next time.

**Status:** informational, agent-owned discipline note (no operator
action needed)

## 2026-08-30 — deep-retro status pass

Read every proposal above. No new hourly-agent proposals since the
2026-08-29 pass; all prior statuses stand. Updates:

- **.gitignore ask (2026-08-28 item 1): still open.** No scratch-file
  recurrence this window either; the ignore entries remain the durable fix.
- **Blend re-open tracking:** blend[disagreement] n=73, w_opt 0.651,
  delta −0.0048. w_opt is under the operator's 0.9 bar for a second
  consecutive day, but n is 73/100 — no ask yet, tracking continues.
- **Real-mode push fix (operator-actioned 2026-08-29): observed working.**
  Real-ledger settle sweeps record cleanly (DepositWallet empty, nothing
  to sweep); no further operator action needed.
- **Context for the operator, no action asked:** both Lake America No
  legs (bbe450e04eb9 $5 @0.668, 6f7dfb5b7c0c $5 @0.38) marked ~0.001
  after all five rename-deadline markets converged to ~0.998 Yes on
  2026-08-30 03:52Z; with GTA VI (c6f16acc55d9, mid 0.017) that is ~$15
  of the $20 open effectively dead, settling Sep 1–4. The fix is
  agent-owned and enacted (playbook fact-finality gate, DEEP-2026-08-30):
  claimed edge > 0.10 now requires an already-immutable fact or a live
  cross-market inconsistency — documented-but-unfinished processes no
  longer qualify. No config/ or core/ change needed.

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: the
.gitignore entries, unchanged)

## 2026-08-31 — deep-retro status pass

Read every proposal above. One new hourly-agent item since the 2026-08-30
pass:

- **2026-08-30 14:12Z title-window ≠ resolution-window quirk: ENDORSED,
  and now evidence-backed at n=1.** The very market that surfaced the
  quirk (3954519, BTC touch-$80k "Aug 24-30" actually created Aug 28)
  settled No on 2026-08-31: the window-corrected read (est No 0.88 vs mid
  0.80, forecast 9618a7d0872d) WON, and the naive title-window read would
  have been badly wrong (BTC touched $81k inside the *title* window but
  before creation). Status stays informational/agent-owned; the
  read-the-description discipline is confirmed useful, not just
  theoretical.

Tracking updates:

- **Blend re-open tracking:** blend[disagreement] n=78, w_opt 0.720,
  delta −0.0032 (score.py this run). Third consecutive pass with w_opt
  under the operator's 0.9 bar; n now 78 of the required 100. No ask yet —
  at the current settlement rate the n≥100 gate is roughly a week out;
  the ask should be filed by the deep retro that first sees n≥100 with
  w_opt still ≤0.9.
- **.gitignore ask (2026-08-28): still open**, still the only outstanding
  operator ask. No scratch-file recurrence this window.
- **No new operator asks from this pass.** The window's two defects
  (spread-trap escalation waste, and the two veto rows my own resolve run
  settled) were both agent-owned and fixed in this commit
  (strategy/screener-prompt.md hard rule; playbook counterfactual-ledger
  extension).

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: the
.gitignore entries, unchanged)

## 2026-09-01 — deep-retro status pass

Read every proposal above. No new hourly-agent proposals since the
2026-08-31 pass.

- **.gitignore ask (2026-08-28): ACTIONED by the operator** (commit
  0d760c1, operator-notes 2026-08-31 ~21:30Z). Scratch filenames ignored
  plus a `work/` directory convention for per-run working files; the
  operator asked that this be marked actioned on this pass — done. The
  cycle-procedure pointer at `work/` is agent-owned and can land whenever
  the relevant playbook/CYCLE-adjacent steps are next touched (CYCLE.md
  itself is operator-owned; the agent's own file references are not).

Tracking updates:

- **Blend re-open tracking:** blend[disagreement] n=90, w_opt 0.70,
  delta −0.0044 (score.py this run). Fourth consecutive pass with w_opt
  under the operator's 0.9 bar; n now 90 of the required 100. No ask yet
  — at the current settlement rate the n≥100 gate is 1-2 passes out; the
  ask files the first pass that sees n≥100 with w_opt still ≤0.9.
- **2026-08-30 title-window quirk note:** unchanged, endorsed at n=1;
  no new instances this window.

**No new operator asks from this pass.** The window's two defects were
agent-owned and fixed same-day by the hourly agent (position-monitoring
sign-check rule, RETRO-20260831-1619) or closed by this retro (touch-
family gate ruling; screener spread-trap fix regraded effective 63%→22%).

**Status:** informational (open operator asks after this pass: NONE —
first pass with a clean slate since 2026-08-28)

## 2026-09-02 — deep-retro status pass

No new proposals from the hourly agent this window (2026-09-01 04:46Z →
2026-09-02 04:21Z). No open operator asks carried in. One tracked
condition fired and is reported here as promised:

**Blend re-open gate: FIRED ON THE LETTER, recommendation is DO NOT
ADOPT.** The operator's 2026-08-25 condition ("think n ≥ 100 and w_opt
≤ 0.9 on the disagreement slice") is now met numerically: n=111 settled
disagreement rows, w_opt=0.892. But the material half of the condition
("w_opt drops materially below 1.0") is not: the improvement at w_opt is
−0.0005 brier vs the market (brier 0.1427 vs 0.1432), and the trajectory
as n grew is the tell — w_opt 0.622 at n=70 → 0.70 at n=90 → 0.892 at
n=111, i.e. the apparent below-market optimum is converging TOWARD the
market as the sample fills in, the signature of a small-sample artifact,
not a stable blending edge. A 0.0005 brier improvement would also never
survive fill costs as a trading rule. Status: gate condition formally
discharged (this is the ask the DEEP-2026-09-01 pass promised to file at
n≥100); recommendation is no adoption and no build. score.py prints the
sweep every run for free, so passive tracking continues; suggested
re-raise bar if the operator wants one kept on file: w_opt ≤ 0.80
sustained at n ≥ 150.

Status: REPORTED — operator may close the 2026-08-25 blend re-open
condition as resolved-negative, or set the new bar above.

Housekeeping noted for the record (agent-side, already fixed, no operator
action): the 2026-09-01 08:19Z LIGHT tick deferred grading of 2 settled
forecasts on a "carrier rule is ledger-only" reading that contradicts
schedule.json's own "settles ANYTHING" wording; both rows were routine
market-agrees/no-edge wins (Iran blackout daa8218bb25d, JPM $1T
38e50222e784), graded 19h late in DEEP-2026-09-02, and the rule wording
is now explicit that forecast-only settlements carry the same duty.

## 2026-09-03 — deep-retro status pass

No new proposals from the hourly agent this window (2026-09-02 04:48Z →
2026-09-03 04:21Z). Actions on tracked items:

- **Blend re-open condition (operator, 2026-08-25): RESOLVED-NEGATIVE —
  closed.** Per the operator's 2026-09-03 ~00:20Z note, the 2026-08-25
  condition is closed as a small-sample artifact (fired on the letter at
  n=111/w_opt 0.892, improvement −0.0005 brier, trajectory converging
  toward the market). The replacement bar on file: w_opt ≤ 0.80 at
  n ≥ 150, sustained across two consecutive deep-retro passes both at
  n ≥ 150, with improvement at w_opt ≥ 0.002 brier vs market. No
  calibrate.py, no blend rule until then.
- **Blend tracking line (this run's score.py):** blend[disagreement]
  n=114, w_opt 0.915, delta −0.0003. Moving away from the new bar, as
  the operator's trajectory read predicted.
- **gnhf forward test (operator, pre-registered 2026-09-02): acknowledged,
  hands off.** strategy/policy.py v3 is the object under test
  (`core/replay.py --after 2026-09-02T00:14:36Z`, ≥15 forward bets,
  criteria mechanical, daily CI trigger). This retro audited but did not
  touch it; nothing from its in-sample replay scores was adopted into
  risk.json or the playbook. The one crossover noted for the record: its
  longshot-bias finding agrees with the bet ledger's own calibration
  (all 6 settled bets with est <0.5 lost) and with the standing
  sub-0.10-price rule — convergent evidence, not yet adoption evidence.

**No new operator asks from this pass.** Open operator asks after this
pass: NONE.

**Status:** informational

## 2026-09-04 00:40Z — collision-guard gap: two concurrent FULL cycles both bet the same leg

**Structural finding, not a request to work around a protected rule.**
Two FULL cycles ran essentially simultaneously starting ~00:16-00:26Z: a
cloud cycle (this one) and an operator-machine real-mode cycle. Both
started from the same tip (`e3d2cb7`, an `operator:` commit, not a
`cycle:`/`cycle(triggered):` commit), so CYCLE.md step 0's collision
guard — which only checks whether the tip is a recent cycle commit — did
not fire for either. Both independently scanned, screened, researched
the August 2026 NFP bracket set via the mechanical-econ carve-out
(different sourcing details, same conclusion), and placed a $5 bet on
the identical leg (market 3403942, "add 0-50k", No side, ~$0.67 entry).
The operator-machine cycle's push (via `loop.sh`) landed on origin/main
first; this cycle's `git push` was rejected, and the follow-up
`git pull --rebase` hit a genuine conflict on `journal/ledger.jsonl`
(two distinct valid rows for the same market+outcome) — aborted per
CYCLE.md step 9's explicit rule rather than hand-resolved. This cycle
reset to the already-pushed state and declined to place a second bet on
the same leg (see the `declined` entry in `strategy/funnel.jsonl` for
this cycle, `2026-09-04T00:16:34Z`).

No capital-safety issue: two $5 bets on the same leg would have summed
to exactly `max_stake_per_event_usd` (10.0), not over it, and the second
bet was never actually placed. The real cost was research/compute
duplication (two independent 15-batch haiku screening runs, two
independent NFP research passes) and a `journal/screener-quota.json`
lost-update race (both cycles read the day's usage as 0 and wrote 15;
corrected by hand this cycle to 30/600 to reflect both runs — the
formula itself is fine, the race is in reading-then-writing without a
lock, same shape as the ledger collision).

**What I'm flagging, not fixing:** the collision guard's definition of
"another runner just cycled" (tip is a `cycle:`/`cycle(triggered):`
commit < 20min old) misses the case where the tip is a non-cycle commit
(an `operator:` commit here) but another FULL cycle is *concurrently in
flight* from that same tip. A guard keyed only on the committed tip
can't see a concurrent uncommitted run by construction — this may need
something outside what a single agent invocation can enforce (a lock
file, a shorter polling/backoff window, or accepting occasional
duplicate bets as a bounded cost given the $10/event cap already bounds
the downside). Leaving the mechanism design to the operator; recording
the evidence per CYCLE.md's "a structural oddity in my inputs is a
proposal, not a shrug."

**Status:** ENDORSED (DEEP-2026-09-04) — see the 2026-09-04 deep-retro
status pass below for the remedy sketch; operator decision pending.
`core/screen_rank.py`, `journal/screener-rank-decision.md`
and `strategy/screener-filters.json` also landed in the operator-machine
cycle's commit (`d9158ee`, message prefix `cycle:` not `operator:`) --
these read as operator-authored (the file's own docstring says "PROTECTED
CORE" and references `journal/operator-notes.md`), most likely picked up
by that cycle's `git add -A` from files staged in the working directory
rather than written by the agent. Not reverted (reverting real operator
work would be its own mistake) and not this cycle's call to make either
way -- flagged for visibility since it crossed the boundary-guard's
commit-prefix convention.

**CI confirmation (00:41Z):** `core/ci.py` now reports `d9158ee` failing
the `Agent/operator boundary` check, confirming the cause diagnosed
above (core/screen_rank.py etc. landing in a non-`operator:`-prefixed
commit). Per CYCLE.md step 0c, the cause lives in a protected path
(`core/`), so the required action is documenting it here rather than
attempting a fix — already done above before this confirmation arrived.
No agent-side fix applies: the boundary guard is protected-path CI, and
correcting it (re-committing those files under an `operator:` prefix, or
`loop.sh`'s revert-on-protected-change logic) is the operator's/loop.sh's
move, not mine to make.

## 2026-09-04 — operator-machine and cloud histories have diverged for three ticks; loop.sh cannot push

**Symptom (hourly agent, 01:29Z, 02:33Z, 03:53Z ticks on the operator
machine, real mode):** `git fetch origin main` succeeds, but local `main`
and `origin/main` are genuinely diverged. Local carries the operator
commit 099039f (gnhf 3) plus the 00:26Z, 01:29Z, 02:33Z and 03:53Z cycle
and retro commits; origin carries the cloud commits 0664b36 (cycle
00:38Z), 6a23fd0 (chore) and 7ea4781 (cycle 02:14Z). Per CYCLE.md step 0
the agent continued on local state each time and never reset, which is
the correct rule, but nothing publishes: `PHIL_PUSH_BY_LOOP=1` hands the
push to `loop.sh`, whose non-fast-forward path is `git pull --rebase`
then push, and the rebase cannot apply because both sides appended to
`journal/cycles.log`, both sides rewrote `strategy/schedule.json`, and
both sides settled different rows in `journal/forecasts.jsonl` (the cloud
02:14Z tick settled the Sakkari row; the operator 02:33Z tick settled it
again locally, then this tick settled five GTA VI rows). loop.sh aborts
the rebase and warns; the next tick starts from the same diverged state.

**Cause:** two runners cycling on the same hours. The step-0 collision
guard only demotes a tick that lands within 20 minutes of the other
runner's commit; it does not handle sustained parallel runners whose
pushes interleave. The cloud routine kept cycling while `./loop.sh
--real` was running on the operator machine, and the first rejected push
made every later local commit unpushable.

**What the agent cannot do:** resolve the conflicts. `forecasts.jsonl`
and `ledger.jsonl` are core-written; hand-merging them is forbidden.
`loop.sh` and CYCLE.md are operator-owned.

**Asks (operator):**
1. Reconcile once by hand: merge origin's three commits into local main
   keeping BOTH sides' journal rows (cycles.log and funnel.jsonl are
   append-only, union them; schedule.json take the newer reason and the
   union of watch-item checkpoints; forecasts.jsonl needs both sides'
   settlement fields, then `python3 core/resolve.py` to re-settle
   idempotently), then push.
2. Prevent the recurrence structurally: pause the cloud routine while the
   operator loop runs (or have loop.sh pause it), and consider a
   `.gitattributes` `merge=union` driver for the append-only journal
   files (`journal/cycles.log`, `strategy/funnel.jsonl`,
   `journal/screener.jsonl`, `journal/mech-requests.jsonl`) so an
   interleaved push only ever conflicts on files that carry state.

**Status:** ACTIONED (operator, 2026-09-04 ~06:20Z note: histories
merged in 0339210, both runners' rows kept, quota re-summed). Closed by
DEEP-2026-09-05.

## 2026-09-04 — deep-retro status pass

Audit window 2026-09-03 04:30Z → 2026-09-04 04:30Z. Full analysis in
journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-04.md.

**Collision-guard gap (hourly agent, 2026-09-04 00:40Z): ENDORSED.**
The finding is correct and well-evidenced: a tip-commit-based guard
cannot see a concurrent in-flight run by construction, and the same
read-modify-write race independently hit journal/ledger.jsonl (push
conflict) and journal/screener-quota.json (lost update, 15 vs 30).
The agent's handling was exemplary — declined the duplicate bet,
aborted the conflicted rebase per rule, hand-corrected the quota with
an audit note. Remedy sketch, both halves operator-owned (loop.sh /
core/): (1) a lock file or lease pushed as a lightweight ref at cycle
start, honored by both runners; or (2) accept duplicate bets as a
bounded cost (the $10/event protected cap held here by exactly $0) and
fix only the quota race, which unlike the ledger has no conflict
detection at all. Recommend at minimum half (2): the quota race is
silent and cumulative; the ledger race at least fails loudly at push.
Status: ACTIONED IN PART (operator, 5987081/06b4349, 2026-09-04: quota
split per runner kills the silent counter race; union merge for
append-only journals). The full-cycle lease half stays OPEN — operator
ask (needs the cloud trigger prompt as well as loop.sh, per the
2026-09-04 ~07:20Z note). Marked by DEEP-2026-09-05.

**NEW operator ask — cure the d9158ee boundary breach.** Commit
d9158ee (`cycle:` prefix) carries core/screen_rank.py,
journal/screener-rank-decision.md and strategy/screener-filters.json —
operator gnhf-run-3 artifacts swept from the working tree by the
cycle's `git add -A`. CI's boundary guard correctly fails it, and every
subsequent push inherits a red history check until it is blessed or
re-attributed. Only the operator can cure this (re-commit under
`operator:`, amend the guard's allowlist for that sha, or whatever
loop.sh's revert logic prescribes); no agent-side fix is legal. The
agent-side halves are done: files audited (screener-filters.json is
dormant, nothing live reads it), nothing reverted, provenance
documented. Status: ACTIONED (operator, 2026-09-04 ~06:20Z note:
d9158ee blessed as-is, guard checks each pushed range so CI is green;
root cause — gnhf in the live checkout — fixed by separate worktrees).
Closed by DEEP-2026-09-05.

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**
- Blend: blend[disagreement] n=122, w_opt=0.837, delta −0.0012 — bar
  (≤0.80 at n≥150, delta ≥0.002, sustained ×2) not met, drifting away.
- Screener replay: 18,047 rows scored; live rev f7ddad12 excess
  +0.0033, z +2.1 — unchanged from operator's gnhf run 2 note;
  screener-prompt.md untouched per freeze.
- gnhf policy v3 forward test: 34 forward rows, 3 bets, pnl +2.71,
  brier_delta −0.0114 — under the ≥15-bet bar, insufficient data,
  hands off.

Open operator asks after this pass: **2** (collision-guard mechanism,
d9158ee boundary cure).

## 2026-09-04 08:xxZ — `core/screen.py collect` exits 1 on its own summary line after the per-runner quota change (hourly agent)

**Symptom (this cycle, operator machine, work dir
`reports/screener-work/20260904T080505Z`):** `python3 core/screen.py
collect --dir ...` validated all 15 out files, appended 300 rows to
`journal/screener.jsonl`, wrote the `collected` marker and printed the
top-15 rows on stdout, then crashed:

```
File "core/screen.py", line 902, in cmd_collect
    f"{int(quota.get('batches') or 0)}/{cfg['max_batches_per_day']}",
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Cause:** commit 5987081/06b4349 changed `load_quota()` to return
`(own, by_runner, total_batches)` (docstring at line 297-305), and
`cmd_prepare` was updated to unpack it, but the stderr summary in
`cmd_collect` (line 899-903) still treats the return value as the old
dict. Every collect now exits 1 after doing all of its work.

**Impact:** side effects are complete, so the cycle proceeded on the
printed top rows and the appended journal rows (the funnel line for this
cycle records `screened: 300, escalated: 15`). But the summary line
`screen: collected X/Y ... day batches Q/CAP` that CYCLE.md step 4 says to
read is never printed, and an exit code of 1 from a protected tool is
exactly the signal an agent would otherwise treat as "collect yielded
nothing, fall back to unscreened selection". A less careful reading would
have discarded a valid screen.

**Proposed fix (protected path, operator act):** in `cmd_collect` unpack
the tuple, e.g. `_own, _by_runner, total = load_quota()` and print
`{total}/{cfg['max_batches_per_day']}` (optionally the per-runner split
as prepare already does). Reproduce with any complete work dir:
`python3 core/screen.py collect --dir reports/screener-work/20260904T080505Z`
(it will refuse to re-append because the marker exists, but the crash is
after the marker check only on a fresh dir — a unit-level call of the
summary block is enough).

**Status:** ACTIONED (operator, e941cd8, 2026-09-04 ~22:15Z note;
confirmed clean by the 2026-09-05 04:20Z cycle's collect). Closed by
DEEP-2026-09-05.

## 2026-09-04 16:2xZ — Astra by-Sep-N sibling markets' `endDate` reads today, not the titled deadline

**Evidence:** screener escalated market 4201768, "Will OpenAI's Astra
model be released by September 7, 2026?" (divergence 0.275). Its
sibling legs 4201767 (by-Sep5), 4201769 (by-Sep8), 4201770 (by-Sep6) —
one already vetoed at 12:52Z, one already no-edge at 14:35Z — all share
the exact same `endDate`: `2026-09-04T23:59:00Z`, i.e. TODAY, not their
titled deadline. Verified directly against Polymarket's own gamma API
(`gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets/4201768`, fetched independently of
`core/scan.py`, so this is not a scan-side artifact): `endDate:
"2026-09-04T23:59:00Z"`, `closed: false`, `active: true`,
`startDate: "2026-09-04T00:17:46Z"`. The market's own description says
resolution hinges on "the listed date (ET)" — i.e. the titled Sep7 date
— not on `endDate`. Two sibling legs in this same event family
(4054724 by-Sep11, 4060944 on-Sep5) do NOT have this problem — their
`endDate` matches their title correctly. This is a different shape than
the already-endorsed 2026-08-30 14:12Z title-window quirk (a market
created *after* its title's window start, narrowing the eligible
window) — here `endDate` reads *before* the title's own stated
deadline, on a subset of same-event siblings only.

**Impact:** unclear whether this is (a) harmless — `endDate` just
governs UI/trading-close behavior on a per-day-created series while
real resolution still waits for the titled ET deadline, or (b) a real
bug where these specific markets could auto-resolve or stop trading
tonight despite their title promising a later deadline. I did not treat
`endDate` as the operative resolution date (used the title's Sep7 ET
date instead, staying conservative and consistent with today's other
Astra legs) and did not bet on the ambiguity either way — the fact-
finality gate already covers this family regardless (forecast
d179339fe4c0, no bet). Flagging because if `endDate` **is** load-
bearing for `core/resolve.py`, these four legs could resolve or freeze
unexpectedly tonight in a way that wouldn't match their titles, and
because a future cycle reading `endDate` naively (e.g. to sort by time-
to-resolution) would be misled the same way the screener's divergence
score nearly was here.

**Proposed action:** none required to core — this may just be how
Polymarket structures this market family and not a bug at all. Worth an
operator or deep-retro spot-check of whether these four legs actually
resolve/freeze tonight as `endDate` implies, or keep trading past it (in
which case `endDate` is simply unreliable for this series and future
research should read the description's stated deadline, not the field).

**Status:** ENDORSED as informational and CLOSED AS MOOT
(DEEP-2026-09-05) — the whole family resolved Yes on the actual Sep-4
Astra release (RETRO-20260904-2215) before the endDate ambiguity could
bite, so whether `endDate` was load-bearing was never tested. Standing
lesson kept: for per-day-created release series, `endDate` is
unreliable — read the description's stated (ET) deadline.

**NEW operator ask — amend the countable-metric veto-narrowing trigger

the 20–22M sibling) — the same one-family/held-out artifact the same
operator note flagged on the Astra +34u cluster. A held-out-fold split
cannot see that snapshots of one event are one observation.
DEEP-2026-09-05 therefore did NOT open the carve-out. Proposed
replacement bar, mechanical: 5 settled countable-metric rows across
**≥3 independent events** (distinct gamma events, the clustering
screen_replay.py already uses), negative brier_delta, positive pnl on
3 of 4 held-out folds. The trigger is operator-registered, so amending
it is an operator act; until answered, each deep-retro pass quotes the
countable-metric line and holds the veto boundary unchanged.
Status: ACTIONED (operator, 2ac62b7 + 2026-09-06 ~00:30Z note; closed in the 2026-09-06 status pass — this line was left stale and is corrected by the 2026-09-08 pass).

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**

## 2026-09-06 ~00:13Z — cloud runner cannot push refs/phil/lease (403, not a race)

First cloud cycle to run against the new lease (commit 9d55035/4322857,
operator note ~00:45Z). `python3 core/lease.py acquire` reported
`{"held": false, "mine": false, "fresh": false, "runner": null,
"age_s": null, "sha": null, "acquired": false, "me": "cloud", "reason":
"lost the race: fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly"}` — twice,
identically, ~30s apart.

Isolated the cause by hand: `git ls-remote origin refs/phil/lease`
returns exit 2 (ref genuinely absent — no one holds it), and
`git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main --dry-run` succeeds cleanly (the
cloud credential CAN push the branch). But pushing a commit to
`refs/phil/lease` itself fails every time with `error: RPC failed; HTTP
403` / `fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly`. This is not
`lease.py`'s documented "lost the race" case (someone else grabbed a
free lease between read and write) — the re-read after the failed push
still shows the ref absent. It looks like the cloud environment's git
credential (a GitHub App/installation token, presumably scoped to
`refs/heads/*` and `refs/tags/*`) is not permitted to write arbitrary
custom refs at all.

If that's right, `lease.py acquire` will report `acquired: false` on
**every** cloud invocation from now on, indistinguishable in the JSON
from a genuine foreign-held lease, and CYCLE.md step 0 reads any
`acquired: false` as "run LIGHT" — so the cloud runner is now
permanently demoted to LIGHT ticks regardless of whether the operator
machine is running at all, silently, until this is fixed. That's a
regression from before this lease existed (cloud ran FULL cycles on its
own pacing). Followed CYCLE.md literally this cycle (treated
`acquired: false` as LIGHT, per instructions — did not attempt to work
around the protected `core/lease.py` push logic).

Possible fixes (operator call, not mine): grant the cloud credential
write access to `refs/phil/*`, or move the lease to a mechanism that
doesn't need a custom-ref push from the cloud side (e.g. a lease file
committed to `journal/` on `main` itself, or a GitHub Actions/API-based
lock). Until answered, expect every cloud cycle to log a LIGHT tick with
this reason.

Open operator asks after this entry: **3** (this one; countable-metric
trigger amendment is now closed per the operator's 2026-09-06 ~00:30Z
note — pending my own mark on next deep-retro pass).

**Status:** ENDORSED, URGENT (DEEP-2026-09-06). Verified against
cycles.log: 00:13Z and 04:14Z scheduled ticks both demoted to LIGHT on
the identical 403 isolation (branch dry-run push succeeds, custom-ref
push fails, ref absent on re-read — not a race). Because the demotion
happens at CYCLE.md step 0, schedule.json's min_full_cycles_per_day
guardrail never gets consulted: the cloud runner runs ZERO full cycles
until this is fixed, a regression to worse than pre-lease behavior.
Operator options, any of which the agent side can live with: (1) grant
the cloud credential write to refs/phil/*; (2) move the lease to a file
on main or an API-based lock; (3) amend core/lease.py to treat "403 on
lease push AND ref absent on re-read" as acquired-degraded (the tip
guard still protects that tick). Operator escalated by notification on
this pass.

## 2026-09-07 13:51Z — simultaneous-start collision the tip guard cannot see (diverged histories)

**Symptom:** local `main` is `ahead 2, behind 1` of `origin/main` at the
start of the 13:46Z operator-machine tick. The cloud runner committed
`18b2c4f cycle: 20260907-1241` (12:41:13Z log line, pushed 12:41:35Z) and
the operator machine committed `eb517ec retro:` + `043686e cycle:
20260907-1241` (12:41:00Z log line). Both were LIGHT ticks; both saw the
same tip (`be527bf`, ~56-61 min old) and cleared the 20-minute collision
guard, because they started within ~15 seconds of each other and neither
commit existed yet when the other checked. The lease cannot help here:
LIGHT ticks do not take it, and the cloud runner's lease write is refused
anyway (`written: false`).

**Cost:** both ticks settled the same two forecasts (AfD 38-41
`9036c73ddeef`, Wellington 10C `b838efbe4ade`), both wrote a retro
(`RETRO-20260907-1238.md` cloud, `RETRO-20260907-1241.md` local) and both
extended the playbook counterfactual table. The two edits agree on every
number (118 rows / 110 fillable / 47W/63L / +$68.66 / held-out +$102.67),
so nothing is wrong in the data, but the same hunk was rewritten twice, so
`git pull --rebase` conflicts on `strategy/playbook.md` and
`journal/cycles.log` (and likely `journal/forecasts.jsonl`, both runners
appended settlement rows for the same forecasts). loop.sh's rebase-and-retry
therefore failed after the 12:41Z tick and every later local commit stacks
on the unpushed side. The 13:46Z tick (this one) continues on local state
per step 0 and does not touch the divergence.

**Proposed fix (operator, protected paths):**
1. Resolve now by hand: keep either retro (they grade identically), keep
   one playbook hunk, union the two cycles.log lines, and de-duplicate the
   forecast settlement rows if both sides appended them.
2. Make the guard robust to simultaneous starts: after committing, before
   pushing, re-fetch and if a `cycle:` commit for the same UTC minute (or
   within N minutes) landed on origin in the meantime, drop the local
   cycle commit rather than rebase it (a LIGHT tick has nothing that the
   other runner's tick did not already do). Alternatively offset the two
   runners' schedules so their minute-of-hour can never coincide; the
   cloud routine fires at a drifting minute (08:16, 10:14, 12:41), so a
   fixed offset on the local loop is not enough on its own.

**Status:** open operator ask.

**Update 2026-09-07 17:5xZ (operator-machine FULL cycle):** still
diverged, now local ahead 6 / origin ahead 4 (merge-base `be527bf`). The
Grüne settlement was double-graded the same way: local `bfe4a1c retro:`
(16:13Z) and cloud `7c8763d retro:` (16:19Z) both graded
`66131e6b8f76` and both extended the counterfactual table, so the next
rebase conflicts on the same three files again. Nothing in the data
disagrees; the duplicate work is the cost. Continuing on local state
per step 0; loop.sh pushes.

**Update 2026-09-07 19:0xZ (operator-machine LIGHT tick):** still
diverged, now local ahead 8 / origin ahead 6. Third duplicate grading:
the SPD 7-9pct no-edge row `1d316aebfe91` was retro'd on both sides
(local `a7795e4` 17:58Z, cloud `00e38f5` 18:13Z). Every settlement since
12:41Z has now been graded twice, and the unpushed local side carries the
Iran clause-misread supersede (`1063bcaec323`) and its playbook rule that
the cloud runner cannot see. Continuing on local state per step 0.

**Update 2026-09-07 20:0xZ (operator-machine LIGHT tick):** still
diverged, now local ahead 9 / origin ahead 6 (merge-base `be527bf`).
No new cloud commit since `e3b82b7` (18:19Z), so no fourth duplicate
grading this hour; the 19:06Z local cycle commit `66751dc` is the only
addition to the unpushed side. Nothing settled on either side since. The
gap is now a full afternoon of operator-machine work (3 retros, the Iran
supersede and playbook rule, 6 cycle lines) that the cloud runner cannot
see, and each cloud tick that grades a settlement first makes the manual
merge one hunk longer. Continuing on local state per step 0; loop.sh
pushes and will keep failing the rebase until the operator merges by
hand.

journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-08.md.

Statuses set this pass:

1. **Simultaneous-start collision (2026-09-07 13:51Z):** ACTIONED IN
   PART (operator, d79e161 2026-09-07 21:57Z) — the by-hand merge
   (proposed fix 1) is done: origin is canonical, the duplicate
   gradings were reconciled with a MERGE NOTE in the playbook table,
   and both pre-registered rulings (Wellington sd, small-party sd) were
   carried. Proposed fix 2 — making the guard robust to
   simultaneous starts (drop-not-rebase for same-minute LIGHT cycle
   commits, or a fixed minute offset for the local loop) — is NOT yet
   addressed and remains the **one open operator ask**. The failure
   mode recurs whenever both runners tick within the same ~20s.
2. **Pre-registered veto-relaxation fork (operator note 2026-09-07
   ~20:50Z):** ACTIONED this pass — playbook section "Outside-view-veto
   relaxation fork (pre-registered, DEEP-2026-09-08)". Condition 1
   tightened to the two MOST RECENT folds (the ledger argues for it:
   f3/f4 hold the best pnl and the worst per-fold dBrier). Bar today:
   NOT MET (per-fold dBrier f3 +0.049, f4 +0.020 both positive; events
   80/40 met; fold pnl met). The veto is untouched.
3. **Stale status line on the countable-metric trigger amendment
   (2026-09-05 ask):** corrected in place to ACTIONED — it was closed
   in the 2026-09-06 pass (operator 2ac62b7) but the inline line still
   read OPEN.

New operator ask (small, protected-core):

4. **Per-fold brier_delta in `core/counterfactual.py`.** The
   relaxation fork's condition 1 reads per-fold dBrier, but the tool
   emits only `fold_pnl` (per group). The deep retro currently
   recomputes it read-only from `--json` rows (sort by ts, split into
   `folds` contiguous slices, mean of (est−outcome)²−(market−outcome)²)
   and the recomputed fold pnl differs slightly from the tool's own
   fold boundaries (−34.01/+22.06/+15.15/+18.81/+89.29 vs
   −30.39/+19.61/+28.57/+1.56/+91.94 on the veto slice), so the bar is
   currently quoted from an approximation. Ask: add `fold_brier_delta`
   next to `fold_pnl` in the group dict (and text table), computed on
   the tool's own fold split, so the fork bar is mechanical
   end-to-end. Until then the fork quotes the recipe's numbers and
   labels them approximate.

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**
- Carve-out bar (after `screen_replay.py events --limit 200`, 37 new
  mappings): **not met** — rows 5/5, independent events 1/3,
  brier_delta −0.1367, pnl +$61.68, held-out folds 3/4. Veto unchanged.
- Counterfactual ledger: outside-view-veto 122 rows, 114 CF trades,
  49W/65L, +$111.29, brier_delta +0.0289, held-out +$141.68 — veto
  stays; relaxation fork written, bar NOT MET (see 2).
- Blend: blend[disagreement] n=163, w_opt 0.802, delta −0.0017 — bar
  (≤0.80 at n≥150, delta ≥0.002, sustained ×2) not met; last pass's
  reversal held at w_opt 0.802 but delta shrank (−0.0018 → −0.0017),
  so "sustained" is not on track; keep watching.
- gnhf policy v3 forward test: 110 forward rows, 13 bets, cw_return
  −0.1375, pnl +$31.27, brier_delta +0.0029 — still under the ≥15-bet
  bar, direction improved from last pass (−0.365/−$9.54/+0.0181);
  insufficient data, hands off.
- Screener replay: live rev f7ddad12 s_exc +0.0005, s_ez +0.2 over 64
  batches — no residual skill; screener-prompt.md stays frozen.
- Real ledger: 44 rows, all settle sweeps, zero real fills ever —
  `real.allowed_edge_classes` is ["cross-market"] and the paper book
  has never produced a cross-market bet; dry by design, informational.

Audit verdict this window: no reverts (fourth consecutive clean
window). The Iran clause-misread self-catch (a7795e4: outcome-independent
supersede 0.93→0.40 plus the clause-to-outcome mapping rule) singled
out as the best edit of the window.

Open operator asks after this pass: **2** (collision fix 2, per-fold
dBrier).

**Status:** informational + the two asks above.


## 2026-09-08 ~17:52Z — the unwritable lease produced its first real git divergence

New evidence for the still-open lease ask (2026-09-06 ~00:13Z entry, and
the collision-guard entries of 2026-09-04). This is no longer a
hypothetical failure mode: `main` and `origin/main` are genuinely
diverged right now, 2 ahead / 2 behind off merge-base `4f6968b`.

What happened. The operator runner committed `9448f31` (retro) at
16:18:38Z and `3f1f544` (cycle) at 16:20:59Z. The cloud runner
independently committed `db58ff3` (retro) at 16:19:54Z and `dd87ee7`
(cycle) at 16:19:57Z. Both runners settled the SAME forecast
(`96065826ed50`, Go Ahead Eagles) to the same status and outcome, with
`settled_ts` three minutes apart, and each then wrote its own retro for
it — `RETRO-20260908-1612` locally, `RETRO-20260908-1617` on origin. Two
runners spent a full research cycle each producing the same settlement
and two near-duplicate retros.

Why neither guard caught it. Both guards are structurally blind to a
collision this tight:

1. The step-0 tip guard reads `origin/main`'s tip age. At the moment the
   operator cycle started, origin's tip was the 15:57Z triggered commit,
   over 20 minutes old — the guard correctly saw nothing. The cloud
   cycle's own commits did not exist yet. A tip guard can only see
   finished cycles, which is exactly what the runner lease was
   introduced to fix.
2. The lease could not fix it, because it is still half-broken in the
   direction this proposal has been flagging since 2026-09-06: the cloud
   credential cannot write `refs/phil/lease` (403 on custom refs), so the
   cloud runner never publishes a lease the operator runner could see. On
   this machine `PHIL_LEASE` was `acquired` and loop.sh proceeded, which
   is correct behaviour given the information available — there was
   simply no lease on origin to honour. The lease is currently a
   one-directional signal: the operator can advertise, the cloud cannot.

Consequence, which the operator has to clear by hand. `loop.sh` will
push, be rejected, run `git pull --rebase origin main`, and hit conflicts
on `journal/forecasts.jsonl`, `journal/cycles.log` and
`strategy/schedule.json` — all three touched on both sides. Its rebase
will abort by design (it must never hand-resolve a journal conflict) and
the commits stay local. Per CYCLE.md step 0 this cycle continued on local
state and did not reset or rebase over local commits.

Worth noting for whoever resolves it: the `forecasts.jsonl` conflict is
semantically empty. The two sides wrote byte-identical rows for
`96065826ed50` apart from `settled_ts` (`16:12:19Z` local vs `16:15:16Z`
origin). Taking either side loses no information. The retros are
genuinely different text and both should survive.

What I am asking for, restated with this instance attached. Either grant
the cloud credential write access to `refs/phil/*`, or move the lease off
custom refs entirely so both runners can advertise — the 2026-09-06 entry
suggested a lease file committed to `journal/` on `main` itself, which
has the property that any credential able to push the branch can also
take the lease. Until one of those lands, two runners on the same hour
will keep doing duplicate work and will keep diverging the branch; this
window cost two redundant research cycles, two near-duplicate retros, and
a manual merge.

I am not proposing a workaround in my own paths. Serialising the runners,
skipping a settle, or hand-editing the ledger to dodge a rebase conflict
would each be worse than the divergence.

**Status:** ENDORSED (DEEP-2026-09-09) — evidence verified end-to-end
(twin retros RETRO-20260908-1612/-1617 grade the same forecast three
minutes apart; cycle log confirms both runners burned a research cycle;
the one-directional-lease diagnosis matches the 2026-09-06 operator fix
note). Folded into the standing lease ask; remains an open operator
action.

Statuses set this pass:

1. **Lease divergence proposal (2026-09-08 ~17:52Z): ENDORSED** —
   evidence verified (twin retros for forecast 96065826ed50, two burned
   research cycles, diagnosis consistent with the 2026-09-06 operator
   fix note). It adds the first REALIZED cost to the standing lease ask:
   either grant the cloud credential write access to `refs/phil/*` or
   move the lease into a file on `main`. The agent was right to refuse
   workarounds in its own paths.
2. No other new proposals from the hourly agent this window.

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**
- Veto relaxation fork: slice byte-identical to yesterday (122 rows /
  114 CF trades / +$111.29 / dBrier +0.0289) — **bar NOT MET**, veto
  untouched; per-fold dBrier still quoted from the approximation
  pending the counterfactual.py ask.
- Blend: blend[disagreement] n=165, w_opt 0.843, delta −0.0011 — the
  09-06 reversal did NOT sustain (0.802 → 0.843, delta shrank); bar
  not met, keep watching.
- gnhf policy v3 forward test: 117 rows, 14 bets, cw_return −0.2081,
  pnl +$26.27, brier_delta +0.0034 — under the ≥15-bet bar, cw
  direction worsened; insufficient data, hands off.
- Mechanical-econ carve-out: no carve-out settlements this window;
  bar and kill switch unchanged (rows 5/5, independent events 1/3).
- Screener replay: baseline rev f7ddad12 is STALE (f872b51 edited
  screener-prompt.md, deny-list addition); re-baseline against rev
  6796568 before quoting s_exc/s_ez again.
- Real ledger: 56 rows, all settle sweeps, zero real fills ever — dry
  by design, informational.

Audit verdict this window: no reverts (fifth consecutive clean window).
fa14b26 (no-edge vs wide-spread-veto taxonomy + erratum) singled out as
the best edit — it repaired the agent's own instrument at the cost of a
better-looking record. New playbook rule this pass: event definition +
correlation logging for max_stake_per_event_usd (Swedish trio compliant
under it; graded as one event-night decision at settlement Sep 13).

Open operator asks after this pass: **2** (lease writability / collision

   criterion also fails). Per the 2026-09-02 pre-registration: nothing
   in strategy/ changes, policy.py untouched, dead zone not adopted.
   This tracking line closes.
2. No new proposals from the hourly agent this window.

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**
- Veto relaxation fork: 124 rows / 116 CF trades / 82 events / +$109.91
  / dBrier +0.0264; per-fold dBrier (hand recipe) f3 +0.0981, f4
  +0.0434 both positive — **bar NOT MET**, fork shut (playbook Status
  2026-09-10 updated). Per-fold fold_brier_delta ask stands.
- Blend: blend[disagreement] n=169, w_opt 0.760, delta −0.0027 — **bar
  MET, pass 1 of the 2 consecutive passes required**; Chewy-row
  leverage caveat recorded in the retro; operator ask files only if
  tomorrow's pass also clears at n≥150.
- Mechanical-econ carve-out: no settlements this window; rows 5/5,
  independent events 1/3 — bar and kill switch unchanged. PPI print
  Sep 10 12:30Z is the next live test.
- Screener-value switch bar (first entry): fit 564 rows / 414 events
  (bar 1,000/700); rank decided 0 of 15 slots (bar 8/15). Dormant.
- Screener replay: re-baseline vs rev 6796568 attempted; outcomes-cache
  refresh still running at commit time — s_exc/s_ez remain unquoted,
  stale-baseline flag stands.
- Mech: no deliveries this window; market-aware-with-context paired
  count not yet started (needs an operator-machine cycle with the
  request_context build).
- Real ledger: 56 rows, zero real fills ever — dry by design.

Audit verdict this window: no reverts (sixth consecutive clean window).
c364c6a (Chewy veto-CF-win grading that still ruled "no boundary change
at n=1") singled out as the best edit — it refused its own favorable
anecdote. Settlement-grading discipline clean on every tick.

Open operator asks after this pass: **2** (lease writability /
collision fix; per-fold `fold_brier_delta` in core/counterfactual.py).

**Status:** informational + the two asks above.

## 2026-09-11 — deep-retro status pass + NEW operator ask (blend bar met, pass 2 of 2)

Audit window 2026-09-10 ~05:00Z → 2026-09-11 ~04:55Z. Full analysis in
journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-11.md.

### NEW OPERATOR ASK: market-prior blend — the 2026-09-03 replacement bar is met on two consecutive passes; decision is yours

The bar on file (operator, 2026-09-03: "w_opt ≤ 0.80 at n ≥ 150,
sustained across two consecutive deep-retro passes both at n ≥ 150,
with improvement at w_opt ≥ 0.002 brier vs market. No calibrate.py, no
blend rule until then"):

- Pass 1 (DEEP-2026-09-10): blend[disagreement] n=169, w_opt 0.760,
  improvement 0.0027 — met.
- Pass 2 (this pass, score.py): blend[disagreement] n=171, w_opt
  0.746, improvement 0.0030 — met.

The letter of the bar is satisfied, so this ask is filed as the
2026-09-03 note requires. **Read the fragility analysis before
shipping anything:**

- Leave-one-out on the exact score.py disagreement slice: removing the
  single highest-leverage row (cc0b2361223a, mlb-moneyline, est 0.97
  vs mkt 0.134, won) leaves improvement 0.0013 — BELOW the 0.002 bar.
  Three further rows (cfda85a4abde, e398cebab2e6, ffc3fcdcbaa6) each
  individually move it by ≥0.0010. The pass is single-row fragile.
- Excluding only the Chewy row (ffc3fcdcbaa6, whose scored mid 0.34 is
  the empty-book artifact flagged in DEEP-2026-09-10): n=170, w_opt
  0.786, improvement 0.0020 — exactly at the bar, no margin.
- Direction of drift is real, though: 0.915 (09-03) → 0.843 → 0.760 →
  0.746 across four passes with n growing 114→171. The estimate is
  genuinely starting to add information at the margin; the question is
  whether 0.002 of Brier is yet distinguishable from 3-4 lucky rows.

Recommendation (advisory only): treat the two-pass letter as
necessary, not sufficient — either require the improvement to survive
leave-one-out (≥0.002 after dropping any single row) before writing
calibrate.py, or take a third consecutive pass at n≥180 so no single
row can carry it. If you ship anyway, ship shadow-mode first (blend
recorded per forecast, no bet-side effect) so the rule accrues its own
settled slice before touching money.

Status: PROPOSED (operator decision; agent will keep reporting the
tracking line either way)

### Statuses set this pass

1. No new proposals from the hourly agent this window — nothing to
   endorse or reject.
2. Blend tracking line: see the ask above (bar met, pass 2 of 2).

**Tracked conditions (one-liners, per standing instructions):**
- Veto relaxation fork: 126 rows / 118 CF trades / 84 events /
  +$114.43 / dBrier +0.0246; per-fold dBrier f3 +0.0977, f4 +0.0394
  both positive — **bar NOT MET**, fork shut (playbook Status
  2026-09-11 added; the two RNC utterance CF wins are in the table).
- Mechanical-econ carve-out: rows 6/5 ✓, events 2/3 ✗, dBrier −0.1147
  ✓, pnl +$61.68 ✓, held-out folds 1/3 ✗ — advanced (PPI), not met;
  CPI print Sep 11 12:30Z is the next live test.
- Screener-value switch bar: fit 573 rows / 422 events (bar
  1,000/700); rank still tie-dominated. Dormant.
- Release-calendar memo bar (first tracking line): emitter dormant,
  0 of the first 20 emit-sourced calendar fires accrued.
- Screener replay re-baseline: third attempt; outcomes-cache refresh
  still running at commit time — s_exc/s_ez remain unquoted,
  stale-baseline flag stands.
- Mech: 1 v4 blind delivery this window (2304229, p_yes 0.62 at
  conf 0.6 with no poll data found, vs own 0.14 / mkt 0.18; settles
  Sep 13). Market-aware-paired count still 0 (Pearl Connect release).
- Real ledger: 56 rows, zero real fills ever — dry by design.

Audit verdict this window: no reverts (seventh consecutive clean
window); only pacing edits, all event-anchored and defensible.
Settlement-grading discipline clean on every tick, including this deep
retro's own resolve settlements (RNC pair graded in (c), CF table
extended same-commit).

Open operator asks after this pass: **3** — (1) lease writability /
collision fix; (2) per-fold `fold_brier_delta` in
core/counterfactual.py; (3) the blend-bar decision above.

**Status:** informational + the three asks above.

## 2026-09-12 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-12.md. Summary:

- **No new proposals from the hourly agent this window** — nothing to
  endorse/reject.
- **No new operator asks.** The three standing asks are unchanged:
  (1) lease writability / simultaneous-start collision fix (every
  cloud cycle still logs `written=false`); (2) per-fold
  `fold_brier_delta` in core/counterfactual.py — implementation note
  from today's fourth hand-computation: use the all-rows frame
  (superseded included), it is the frame that reproduces the tool's
  printed fold pnl exactly; (3) the blend-bar decision — today reads
  as **pass 3** (disagreement n=184, w_opt 0.768, improvement 0.0024)
  with the improvement WEAKENING (0.0030 → 0.0024) exactly as the
  fragility analysis attached to the ask predicted. Recommendation
  unchanged: require robustness, don't ship on the letter.
- **Fork status: NOT MET, fifth consecutive reading**, but per-fold
  dBrier f4 went negative (−0.0092) for the first time — flagged for
  the next pass, nothing to act on today.
- **Discipline:** two lapses in the window, both repaired — the
  2026-09-11 16:17Z settlement commit (e081582) graded two
  outside-view-veto rows without the same-commit CF-table extension
  (repaired in this pass's playbook edit), and the 07:28Z triggered
  tick skipped a settlement duty (self-caught one tick later by the
  hourly agent). Second instance each of known classes; no new rule,
  escalation pre-registered in the retro if a third appears.
- **Gate enacted (agent-owned, playbook):** utterance-market base-rate
  gate — Yes-side say-the-word/mention bets need a quoted ≥2-transcript
  frequency base rate or stay forecast-only; evidence and
  pre-registered review in the retro and playbook section.
- **Screener replay re-baseline (rev 6796568): COMPLETED** after four
  attempts — s_exc −0.0011 / s_ez −0.3 over 27 batches (3,316 rows):
  no excess screening skill beyond the mids under the new prompt rev.
  Stale-baseline flag clears; the DEEP-2026-09-01 freeze stands,
  re-confirmed. This closes the item opened DEEP-2026-09-09.

**Status:** informational — no new asks.

## 2026-09-13 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-13.md. Summary:

- **No new proposals from the hourly agent this window** — nothing to
  endorse/reject.
- **No new operator asks.** The three standing asks are unchanged:
  (1) lease writability / simultaneous-start collision (every cloud
  cycle still logs `written=false`); (2) per-fold `fold_brier_delta`
  in core/counterfactual.py (no new hand-computation this pass — no
  veto settlements); (3) the blend-bar decision — no recompute this
  pass (no new relevant data), pass-3-with-weakening-improvement
  stands as filed, recommendation unchanged (require robustness).
- **Fork status: NOT MET, sixth consecutive reading** (frame unchanged,
  no veto settlements in the window); the f4-negative flag from
  2026-09-12 stays armed for tonight's election-cluster settlements.
- **Discipline finding (agent-side, repaired in place, no operator
  action needed):** 7 of the window's 9 FULL cycles omitted their
  mandatory strategy/funnel.jsonl line (selection-instrumentation
  mandate, DEEP-2026-08-05). All 7 backfilled from cycles.log prose
  (flagged); playbook same-commit rule enacted; a mechanical CI-side
  check will be proposed only if the drift recurs.
- **Heads-up, not an ask:** nothing pre-registered for Sep 13 was
  gradable at this pass's 04:42Z run time (Swedish first count ~19:00Z;
  Russia UR results tonight). DEEP-2026-09-14 owns the full grading
  batch: 3 Sweden legs, Russia UR, and the first paired mech
  second-opinion contrast case.

**Status:** informational — no new asks.

## 2026-09-14 — deep-retro status pass + NEW operator ask (funnel weld → CI)

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-14.md. Summary:

- **No new proposals from the hourly agent this window** — nothing to
  endorse/reject.
- **NEW operator ask: enforce the funnel weld at push time in
  core/validate.py (CI).** Spec: any non-`operator:` commit whose diff
  ADDS rows to journal/forecasts.jsonl must, in the SAME commit, also
  add at least one line to strategy/funnel.jsonl; a later commit adding
  a `backfill`-marked funnel line remains the remediation path (the
  check is per-commit and forward-looking only — no retroactive
  flagging of history, mirroring reconcile.py's 24h scope). Evidence:
  nine instances of the forecast-without-funnel class since 2026-08-19.
  The agent-side escalation ladder is exhausted — prose rule
  (DEEP-2026-08-20), same-commit weld, mechanical self-check
  (DEEP-2026-08-21), literal-token proof (DEEP-2026-08-22), explicit
  closure to triggered ticks (DEEP-2026-09-03) — and the class still
  recurred twice on 2026-09-13 (TRIGGERED 22:2xZ and 23:2xZ,
  forecasts ed0496ead6ec / 7348969de07e, no funnel line, no reconcile
  token), the very day DEEP-2026-09-13 armed its recurrence trigger.
  Triggered ticks are exactly the context where a rushed agent skips
  the self-check; only a check the agent cannot skip closes the class.
- **Standing ask 1 (lease writability / simultaneous-start): unchanged,
  one new evidence row** — 2026-09-14 00:25Z TRIGGERED tick reported
  cash $967.98 one minute after the 00:24Z FULL cycle placed a bet
  (cash $962.98): a concurrent runner on a stale view, harmless this
  time only because it placed nothing. 70 `written=false` lines in
  cycles.log to date.
- **Standing ask 2 (per-fold fold_brier_delta): unchanged** — no veto
  settlements this window, no new hand-computation. Note: Sep 20
  settles three correlated German-bracket veto rows at once.
- **Standing ask 3 (blend bar): no recompute** — only near-zero-
  disagreement forecast settlements this window; pass-3-with-weakening-
  improvement stands, recommendation unchanged (require robustness).
- **Release-calendar bar: no calendar-tier fires this window**; 0 of
  the next-20 graded fires elapsed. Bar unchanged.
- **Fork status: NOT MET, seventh consecutive reading** (no veto
  settlements; f4-negative flag stays armed for Sep 20).
- **Discipline:** funnel-weld instances 8–9 (above, self-caught and
  backfilled by the 02:11Z cycle); otherwise clean — one bet placed
  (Russia turnout, audited compliant, event cap now FULL at $10 for
  the Sep 18–20 Russia election), no under-floor/in-play/spread
  breaches. Election-night trio provisionally graded +$10 net as one
  event decision; official settlements pending.

**Status:** one new ask (CI funnel-weld check) awaiting operator
decision; everything else informational.

## 2026-09-15 04:1xZ — screener day-batch quota has no refund path when the subagent tier fails (operator machine, FULL cycle)

**Symptom.** `core/screen.py prepare` (work dir `reports/screener-work/20260915T005654Z`) charged 15 day batches (operator runner, 15/150) at prepare time. All 15 haiku Task subagents then stalled on the harness stream watchdog ("no progress for 600s"), as did a retry on the default model; one batch (10) wrote its out file before stalling. `collect` reported the run as 300 rows (20 real, 280 placeholder rows with null probs/divergence appended to `journal/screener.jsonl`). The day-batch counter stays at 15 spent for a screen that produced one usable batch. Same session: `clob.polymarket.com` stopped resolving (DNS) while gamma stayed reachable, so the stall looks environmental (operator machine network/harness), not a prompt or model problem.

**Why it matters.** The cap exists to bound spend on the screening tier; a run that spends the cap and yields nothing both (a) consumes the day's budget on the cloud/operator split without a ranked pool, and (b) leaves 280 null rows in `screener.jsonl` that any screener-calibration script must filter out (`probs: null`). Neither is fatal today (150/day is generous) but the accounting is wrong in a way that compounds on a bad-network day.

**Asks (all in protected `core/screen.py`).**
1. Let `collect` refund unfilled batches against the day counter (or charge batches at collect time, per out file actually validated), so a stalled tier does not burn the cap.
2. Either skip placeholder rows in `journal/screener.jsonl` for batches with no out file, or mark them with an explicit `status: "missing"` field so downstream evaluators (`core/screen_replay.py`) can exclude them without inferring from `probs: null`.
3. Optional: `collect` prints the fill ratio (`collected 1/15`) on stdout as well as stderr so the funnel line can quote it mechanically.

**What I did instead this cycle.** Fell back to the unscreened selection per CYCLE.md step 4 (watch items + fresh-data candidates), recorded the funnel line with `screened: 300, escalated: 0, screener_batches: 15` and a `screener_note` naming the 1/15 fill, and paced the next FULL 2h out so a fresh session retries the tier.

Status: ENDORSED (DEEP-2026-09-16) — PROPOSED (operator, core/screen.py; asks 1–2 recommended, ask 3 optional).

## 2026-09-15 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-15.md. Summary:

- **No new proposals from the hourly agent this window** — nothing to
  endorse/reject.
- **CI funnel-weld ask (2026-09-14): +1 evidence row, now 10
  instances.** The 2026-09-14 15:26Z TRIGGERED tick (pricemove:4168072,
  commit 62ba798) recorded forecast d43dc1a43dac with no funnel line —
  the first instance to occur AFTER DEEP-2026-09-14 declared the
  agent-side ladder exhausted. reconcile.py caught it at the 18:2xZ
  cycle and the backfill landed per the exemption; remediation works,
  prevention still does not. Spec unchanged; awaiting operator
  decision. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **NEW operator ask: provision ODDS_API_KEY on the operator-machine
  runner.** Evidence: 2026-09-14 21:16Z operator FULL cycle logged six
  benchmark-unreachable skips, three of them purely "odds key not
  provisioned" (Georgia/Arkansas 4350037, Miami/Wake Forest 4350024,
  Brighton/Arsenal 4273054); cloud cycles devig normally (3 credits at
  02:11Z same day). Sports-devig classes (mlb-moneyline n=1 delta
  -0.7421, mlb-spreads n=2 delta -0.0568, book-devig n=1 delta
  -0.0732 — all tiny-n but the only negative cells in the book) are
  structurally invisible on operator ticks until the key exists there,
  and the weekly MLB spot-check comes due ~Sep 17. One env var on one
  machine. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **Standing ask 1 (lease writability / simultaneous-start): unchanged**
  — no new divergence this window; 80 `written=false` lines in
  cycles.log to date.
- **Standing ask 2 (per-fold fold_brier_delta): unchanged** — no veto
  settlements this window; Sep 20 still lands three correlated
  German-bracket veto rows at once.
- **Standing ask 3 (blend bar): no recompute** — zero ledger
  settlements and only small forecast settlements this window;
  pass-3-with-weakening-improvement stands, recommendation unchanged
  (require robustness, don't ship on the letter).
- **Release-calendar bar: no calendar-tier fires this window**; 0 of
  the next-20 graded fires elapsed. Bar unchanged.
- **Fork status: NOT MET, eighth consecutive reading** (no veto
  settlements; f4-negative flag stays armed for Sep 20).
- **Mech window line (counter reset 2026-09-14):** requests 0,
  deliveries 0, market-aware/v4 pairs 0, settled pairs 0. Blocker is
  PEARL_CONNECT_STORE unset on operator-machine cycles (operator setup
  gap per operator-notes 2026-09-14 14:40Z addendum); Pearl 1.9.8 +
  Connect v0.1.4 verified ready.

**Status:** two asks now open for the operator (CI funnel-weld check,
ODDS_API_KEY on the operator runner); everything else informational.

## 2026-09-16 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-16.md. Summary:

- **2026-09-15 04:1xZ screener day-batch quota refund (core/screen.py):
  ENDORSED.** Evidence solid (15 batches charged, 1 usable out file, 280
  `probs: null` placeholder rows appended to screener.jsonl). Asks 1–2
  (refund-or-charge-at-collect, explicit `status: "missing"` on
  placeholder rows) are small and correct; ask 3 (stdout fill ratio)
  optional. Status: ENDORSED — PROPOSED (operator, core/screen.py).
- **CI funnel-weld ask (2026-09-14): unchanged**, no new instance this
  window (the 09-15 02:43Z TRIGGERED tick carried its funnel line).
  Still 10 instances. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner (2026-09-15): RE-URGED.** Operator
  FULL cycles still log "odds key not provisioned"; the weekly MLB devig
  spot-check is due ~Sep 17 and lands on a cloud tick or slips. The only
  negative-delta forecast cells with n≥9 (mlb-moneyline −0.0499 n=15,
  commodities-touch −0.0529 n=9) are exactly the classes invisible on
  operator ticks. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **Lease writability / simultaneous-start: unchanged** (no new
  divergence this window).
- **Per-fold fold_brier_delta (core/counterfactual.py): unchanged** —
  Sep 20 lands three correlated German-bracket veto rows at once;
  having per-fold numbers before then would help. Status: PROPOSED
  (operator).
- **Blend bar: no recompute** (no relevant settlements).
- **Mech window line (counter reset 2026-09-14): requests 0, deliveries
  0, market-aware/v4 pairs 0, settled pairs 0.** Blocker unchanged:
  PEARL_CONNECT_STORE unset on operator-machine cycles (operator setup
  gap; Pearl 1.9.8 + Connect v0.1.4 verified ready).
- **Deep-retro internal TODO (no operator action): playbook compaction.**
  playbook.md is ~320KB/4,900 lines, re-read every FULL cycle. Next deep
  retro on a zero-settlement window: move fully settled narrative
  sections to strategy/playbook-archive.md, keep rules/gates/open
  pre-registrations/counterfactual tables live. Deliberately NOT done
  today (Sep 20 gradings depend on pre-registered text; no rush edit).

**Status:** three asks open for the operator (screener quota refund —
newly endorsed; CI funnel-weld; ODDS_API_KEY), plus the standing
lease/fold-delta items; everything else informational.

## 2026-09-17 04:22Z — watch.py new_market trigger fires on banned-shape sub-daily crypto

TRIGGERED cycle (key `newmarket:4631132`) fired on "Will XRP dip to $1.30 on
September 17?" (gamma id 4631132, created 2026-09-17T04:00:14Z, slug
`will-xrp-dip-to-1pt3-on-september-17-2026`). This is a same-day crypto
price-threshold market — exactly the shape `strategy/screener-filters.json`'s
`crypto_updown`/`crypto_bracket` entries exist to drop before it reaches a
screening subagent, and exactly the shape `strategy/playbook.md` §Avoid
(referencing the protected config) says to skip outright. It's also
mechanically unbettable regardless: gamma showed bestBid/bestAsk 0.999/1.0
(outcomePrices Yes 0.9995) with `umaResolutionStatus: "proposed"` already —
above `max_entry_price` 0.95 on Yes and the mirror No price (~0.0005) below
`min_entry_price` 0.02, so `core/ledger.py place` would reject either side on
protected caps alone even if I wanted in.

Cause: `core/watch.py check_new_markets` (protected) filters new-market
candidates only against `config/protected.json`'s
`banned_question_patterns` — three regexes, all matching literal "Up or
Down" phrasing. It has no access to `strategy/screener-filters.json`'s
broader shape bans (`crypto_updown`, `crypto_bracket`), which live at the
screen.py stage and only apply to the step-4 broad scan, not to watch.py's
independent gamma query. Those two filter entries were themselves added
earlier THIS SAME UTC day (2026-09-17 00:1xZ cycle, per their own notes) for
the identical shape leaking past scan/screen — so the shape-ban knowledge
already exists on the agent side, it just isn't visible to watch.py's
separate new-market path.

Cost so far: one wasted TRIGGERED cycle (1 of the 6/day fire budget, 1 of 3
new-market fires this run) on a candidate that could never clear either the
shape ban or the price-band caps. Low-frequency (sub-daily crypto markets
are a small, bursty slice of gamma's newest-first feed) but will recur every
time one lists with liquidity above the watchlist floor.

Ask: `core/watch.py`'s `check_new_markets` is protected code, so the fix is
the operator's call. Two options that don't require loosening anything: (a)
teach `banned_patterns()` to also load (or duplicate) the shape regexes from
`strategy/screener-filters.json`'s crypto entries, so a new filter added
there covers watch.py too without a protected-file edit each time; or (b)
add a narrow protected-side regex for same-day crypto threshold/bracket
questions (e.g. "dip to $", "reach $", "between $X and $Y" on BTC/ETH/XRP/SOL
etc.) alongside the existing "Up or Down" patterns. (a) stays in sync
automatically; (b) is simpler but needs re-editing whenever a new phrasing
variant shows up, same as the screener-filters.json entries did twice today.
No proposal to loosen price/liquidity floors — those aren't the problem
here, the shape is.

This cycle: no bet, no retro (nothing settled); forecast recorded
(`04a52f6a68c5`, est 0.998, skip-reason market-agrees, category
crypto-touch) since a concrete honest estimate was formed before checking
the price.

**Status (DEEP-2026-09-17): ENDORSED → operator, option (a) preferred.**
Verified: the fire was doubly wasted (shape-banned AND ask 0.999 above
`max_entry_price`, so unbettable on protected caps alone). Option (a) —
`banned_patterns()` additionally loading the crypto shape regexes from
`strategy/screener-filters.json` — keeps one source of truth; the shape
mutated twice within this single UTC day (up/down → bracket → dip-to),
which is exactly the maintenance burden option (b) would re-create on
the protected side.

**Recurrence (2026-09-18 04:22Z, TRIGGERED, cloud):** third phrasing variant,
same root cause. Key `newmarket:4666433`, "Will Solana reach $105 on
September 18?" (gamma id 4666433, created 04:00:12Z, fired 04:22Z). Same
shape (`crypto_bracket`-adjacent, plain "reach $X" this time rather than
"dip to $X" or "between $X and $Y"), same double-waste: bestBid/bestAsk
0.999/1.0 (outcomePrices Yes 0.9995) already at fire time, above
`max_entry_price` 0.95, so unbettable on protected caps alone regardless of
the shape ban. CoinGecko spot check confirmed SOL was already at $105.1 —
the touch had already happened. Forecast `e3b016d8a48f` recorded (est 0.998,
skip-reason market-agrees, category crypto-threshold). No new ask: this is
confirming evidence for the open (a)-preferred ask above, not a new issue —
three distinct phrasings ("up or down", "between $X and $Y", "dip to $X",
now "reach $X") in twelve days makes the option-(b) maintenance burden the
proposal already predicted concrete, not hypothetical.

## 2026-09-17 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-17.md. Summary:

- **watch.py banned-shape gap (2026-09-17 04:22Z, above): ENDORSED**,
  option (a). New operator ask.
- **Screener day-batch quota refund (2026-09-15): ENDORSED, unchanged,
  with operator.**
- **CI funnel-weld check (2026-09-14): open, no new instance this
  window** (all FULL cycles carried funnel lines).
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner: RE-URGED, prediction realized** —
  the weekly MLB devig spot-check landed on a cloud tick (2026-09-17
  02:26Z) because operator FULL cycles remain devig-blind;
  mlb-moneyline is still the best negative-delta forecast cell
  (−0.0499, n=15).
- **Lease writability: open, unchanged** (write-refused again 02:26Z).
- **Per-fold fold_brier_delta in counterfactual.py: RE-URGED with a
  date** — the correlated German-bracket veto cluster settles Sep 20.
- **Mech window line (counter reset 2026-09-14): requests 0,
  deliveries 0, market-aware/v4 pairs 0, settled pairs 0** — blocked on
  PEARL_CONNECT_STORE being unset on operator cycles.
- **Note, not an ask:** second lifetime instance of the same-commit
  CF-table rule being missed (Furniture `3a539d9be02d`, repaired in
  playbook this retro). If a third occurs, propose extending
  reconcile.py check 5 to compare the mechanical ledger's settled-row
  count against the playbook table's row count per veto class.

**Status:** four asks open for the operator (watch.py shape regexes —
new; screener quota refund; CI funnel-weld; ODDS_API_KEY), plus the
standing lease/fold-delta items; everything else informational.

## 2026-09-17 19:4xZ - parallel off-chain mech requests race on the wire nonce (operator machine, FULL cycle)

CYCLE.md 5a asks for a paired market-aware / v4 request on the same mech for
at least one candidate per cycle. This cycle I fired the pair in one message
(two `mech_request` calls in parallel, same `priority_mech` service 21, both
off-chain). The first delivered; the second was refused before payment:

`Offchain request rejected: wire nonce below sender's next expected slot (HTTP 401)`

Request ids: `phil-20260917-2005-urgain-ma-21` (delivered) and
`phil-20260917-2005-urgain-v4-21` (rejected). A sequential retry with a new
id (`phil-20260917-2010-urgain-v4-21-r2`) delivered on the first try. All
three rows are in `journal/mech-requests.jsonl`. No money was lost: the
rejection came before payment.

Cause, as far as I can see from my side: both sends read the same next
nonce for the safe, and the mech accepted whichever arrived first. That
lives in Pearl Connect's off-chain send path, which is not mine to change.

Two asks, either one closes it:

1. One sentence in CYCLE.md 5a: "send mech requests one at a time; parallel
   off-chain sends from one safe race on the wire nonce". I follow this from
   now on regardless, but the next session will not know it unless the
   procedure says so.
2. Or serialize off-chain sends inside Pearl Connect (a per-safe lock around
   nonce read + sign + send), so that parallel tool calls are safe.

The error class is also not in 5a's transient list (EIP-1271 / HTTP 503). I
treated the 401 nonce rejection the same way: one retry with a NEW
request id. If that is wrong, say so there.

**Status (DEEP-2026-09-18): ENDORSED — ask 1 (one CYCLE.md sentence:
send mech requests one at a time; add the wire-nonce 401 to 5a's
transient list with retry-with-new-id as the handling). The behavior is
already adopted (2026-09-17 22:54Z and 2026-09-18 02:15Z funnel notes
both say "sent one at a time") — codifying it stops a fresh session
from rediscovering it. Ask 2 (per-safe send lock) is the durable fix
but lives in Pearl Connect, upstream of this repo; worth relaying, not
blocking. The 401 retry with a NEW request id was correct handling.**

## 2026-09-18 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-18.md. Summary:

- **Mech parallel-send nonce race (2026-09-17 19:4xZ, above):
  ENDORSED, ask 1** (CYCLE.md 5a sentence + transient-list addition);
  ask 2 upstream in Pearl Connect. New operator ask.
- **watch.py banned-shape gap: ENDORSED option (a), RE-URGED** — third
  phrasing variant (`newmarket:4666433`, "reach $X") in 12 days; two
  wasted TRIGGERED fires now; option (b)'s predicted maintenance
  burden is concrete.
- **NEW (operator): real-twin experiment starved by construction.**
  `real.allowed_edge_classes` = ["cross-market"] has produced 1
  qualifying bet lifetime (4ed738b2045b, placed on a paper cycle);
  real-ledger.jsonl has zero fill rows ever (56 rows, all settle
  sweeps). A watch item falsely claiming a Liberals real twin was
  corrected this retro (schedule.json). Recommendation: decide AFTER
  the Sep 20 settlements whether politics-general `other` (n=4,
  brier_delta −0.0502, +$57.62 — thin) earns a second allowed class,
  or accept dormancy until cross-market supply improves.
- **Screener day-batch quota refund (2026-09-15): ENDORSED, unchanged,
  with operator.**
- **CI funnel-weld check (2026-09-14): open, no new instance** (all
  window FULL cycles carried funnel lines).
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner: open, unchanged** — operator FULL
  cycles remain devig-blind; mlb-moneyline still the best negative-
  delta forecast cell (−0.0499, n=15).
- **Lease writability: open, unchanged.**
- **Per-fold fold_brier_delta in counterfactual.py: RE-URGED, dated**
  — the German-bracket veto cluster settles Sep 20; if the flag is not
  in by the first deep retro after those settlements, that fold gets a
  one-off hand analysis instead.
- **Mech window line (counter reset 2026-09-14): requests 14,
  deliveries 13 (1 nonce-race rejection retried OK), market-aware with
  context 9 (market_prob_seen == sent price on all 9), paired ma/v4
  sets 4, settled pairs 0.**

**Status:** five asks open for the operator (mech CYCLE.md sentence —
new; real allowed-classes decision — new, dated to post-Sep-20;
watch.py shape regexes; screener quota refund; ODDS_API_KEY), plus the
standing lease/fold-delta/funnel-weld items; everything else
informational.

## 2026-09-18 21:46Z - recurrence: watch.py new_market fires on line-constructed rungs, daily budget exhausted

Recurrence on the open 2026-09-17 04:22Z proposal (watch.py new_market fires
on shapes the agent already bans; option (a) endorsed by DEEP-2026-09-17).
New shape, new consequence.

**Evidence:** `journal/watch-triggers.jsonl` holds six rows dated 2026-09-18,
which is `DAILY_FIRE_BUDGET`. Four of the six are shapes
`strategy/screener-filters.json` drops before screening: `newmarket:4666433`
(Solana reach $105, ask 0.999) and the three Espanyol v Elche totals rungs
`newmarket:4674701/2/3` (O/U 6.5, 7.5, 8.5; mids 0.022, 0.011, 0.003). The
three rungs match the `line_constructed` regex. They were unbettable on the
protected caps before research: the Over side cannot reach `min_edge` from a
mid under 0.03, the Under side sits above `max_entry_price`. They settled
this tick with brier deltas under 0.0001 (RETRO-20260918-2146). Because each
key counts as one fire, that one 07:22Z run took half the day's budget. The
budget ran out at 15:22Z and the watcher could not fire for the last 8.6
hours of the UTC day, the day voting opened in an election where I hold two
positions.

**What I changed on my side:** nothing that fixes it. `new_market.keywords`
is an allow list, and an allow list narrow enough to stop totals rungs would
also stop the unknown catalyst the trigger exists for. I did add two missing
`price_moves` entries (2046508, 789957); that gap was mine.

**Ask (unchanged, scope widened):** option (a) should load every
`exclude_title_patterns` entry from `strategy/screener-filters.json` in
`check_new_markets`, not only the crypto ones. Separate, smaller ask: count
one `check` run that fires several sibling keys as ONE fire against the daily
budget. Three rungs of one match are one decision.

## 2026-09-18 21:46Z - genuine divergence on the operator machine, second cause on the lease item

**Evidence:** at this tick's step 0, local main was ahead 1 and behind 3
with merge-base d0da028 (not shallow). Local-only: 2bec027, the 16:31Z
operator FULL cycle. Origin-only: f772af1 (cloud FULL 16:22Z), 181f22c,
bdc90e9. The cloud cycle pushed while the operator cycle was mid-flight.
The operator cycle had synced before that push, so loop.sh's push after the
cycle must have been rejected. I did not see loop.sh's output. Both sides
edited `journal/forecasts.jsonl` and `strategy/schedule.json`, the files
`.gitattributes` leaves out of the union merge on purpose, so its rebase
fallback would have stopped there and left the commit local. Both runners
then kept cycling for five hours on different histories. This tick followed CYCLE.md: warned, continued on local
state, reset nothing, and kept its footprint small (LIGHT).

**Cause:** the standing "lease writability" item. The cloud credential
cannot write `refs/phil/lease` (the 06:25Z and 07:23Z cloud log lines today
both record `written=false`), so an in-flight cloud FULL cycle is invisible to the operator runner.
The tip guard only sees finished cycles. Every hour both runners go FULL
inside the same window, the second push loses, and any such pair that both
record forecasts ends in a manual merge.

**Ask:** the operator resolves today's divergence by hand (the local side
adds forecast rows from 16:31Z and 21:46Z plus four settlement updates; the
origin side will settle the same four rows with its own timestamps). For the
cause, either give the cloud credential the right to push the lease ref, or
move the lease to something the cloud can write, for example a lease file on
a dedicated branch.

**Recurrence 2026-09-18 22:49Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
now ahead 3 / behind 5, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a. New on origin since 21:46Z: eef9399 (cloud retro, settles the same
four forecast rows this side settled in 4a42611, so `journal/forecasts.jsonl`
now conflicts on in-place updates as well as appended rows) and bd0ff1d.
Both sides carry a retro for the same four settlements
(RETRO-20260918-2146 local, RETRO-20260918-2211 origin); both can be kept.
This tick again reset nothing and wrote only the cycle log line and this note.
The merge grows every hour the two runners keep cycling apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19 00:0xZ (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 4 / behind 5 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933. Origin unchanged since bd0ff1d (22:13Z); no cloud commit
landed in the 23:xxZ hour. Pacing said FULL (23:00Z passed), so this tick ran
the whole procedure on local state and adds five forecast rows, 300 screener
rows, one funnel row, a schedule.json edit and a strategy/tools/siblings.py
edit to the local side. All of it is append-only except schedule.json, where
the local copy should win on `reason`/`next_full_cycle_after` only if the
operator keeps the local history. Second, smaller item from the same tick:
`core/odds.py` reports no ODDS_API_KEY on the operator runner (env or
`~/.config/phil/odds-api-key`), so the book-devig benchmark is cloud-only
today; the one uncovered escalated row (Dolphins v 49ers) got no forecast.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T01:04Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 5 / behind 6 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933, 3436547. New on origin since the last note: b470160 (cloud
cycle 00:23Z, placed 0 settled 0), so the cloud runner is cycling normally and
each of its FULL cycles adds forecast, screener and funnel rows the local side
does not have. This tick reset nothing and wrote only the cycle log line and
this note. Both runners have now spent about 8.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T02:05Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 6 / behind 6 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933, 3436547, a486957. Origin unchanged since b470160 (00:22Z);
no cloud commit landed in the 01:xxZ hour. This tick reset nothing and wrote
only the cycle log line and this note. The next local FULL cycle is paced for
05:00Z and will add forecast, screener and funnel rows to the local side again,
so the cheapest moment for the manual merge is before then. Both runners have
now spent about 9.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T03:07Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 7 / behind 7 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933, 3436547, a486957, b08039b. New on origin since the last note:
a7b22a8 (cloud cycle 02:13Z, placed 0 settled 0). This tick reset nothing and
wrote only the cycle log line and this note. The next local FULL cycle is still
paced for 05:00Z, so the cheapest moment for the manual merge is before then.
Both runners have now spent about 10.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T04:08Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 8 / behind 7 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 10 after this tick's retro
and cycle commits). Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611, 565143a, 629c933, 3436547,
a486957, b08039b, fb8398c. Origin unchanged since a7b22a8 (02:14Z); no cloud
commit landed in the 03:xxZ hour. This tick reset nothing. It wrote one retro
(RETRO-20260919-0408, a tennis forecast settled on the local side only, so the
cloud runner will settle the same row again and `journal/forecasts.jsonl`
gains one more conflicting line), the cycle log line, and this note. The next
tick is FULL-eligible (05:00Z) and adds forecast, screener, and funnel rows to
the local side, so this hour is the last cheap moment for the manual merge.
Both runners have now spent about 11.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T05:1xZ (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 10 / behind 10 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933, 3436547, a486957, b08039b, fb8398c, b72c659, c374fc8. New on
origin since the last note: 1e8419f (cloud retro for the same tennis forecast
this side settled in b72c659), 9f52114 (cloud cycle 04:20Z) and 2aa1eeb
(DEEP-2026-09-19, which touches only `journal/proposals.md` and its own retro
file, so the local playbook is not stale against it). `journal/proposals.md`
now conflicts on both sides as well: the deep retro appended its status pass on
origin while these recurrence notes were appended here. Pacing said FULL (05:00Z
passed), so this tick ran the whole procedure on local state and adds five
forecast rows (one superseding), 300 screener rows, one funnel row, a
schedule.json edit with a new watch item, the cycle log line, and this note.
Both runners have now spent about 12.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T06:19Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 11 / behind 11 at sync, merge-base d0da028. Local-only: 2bec027, 4a42611,
565143a, 629c933, 3436547, a486957, b08039b, fb8398c, b72c659, c374fc8, 8592a7e.
New on origin since the last note: d92ed7f (cloud cycle 06:12Z, placed 0 settled
0). This tick reset nothing and wrote only the cycle log line and this note.
Both runners have now spent about 13.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T18:10Z (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 12 / behind 20 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 14 after this tick's
retro and cycle commits). The local loop did not run between 06:21Z and 18:10Z.
New on origin since the last note: 5a7e7ed, 2af071c (triggered, pricemove
4118888), ddfe73f (cloud retro for the WTI LOW95 row this side settled again at
18:11Z), 73ab681, 6877624, 690f339, 57b9ca4 (Osasuna retro; forecast
db5e96f96cd8 exists only on origin), acffc23 (triggered, newmarket 4726778), 58abc99.
This tick reset nothing. It adds one retro, four forecast rows, 300 screener
rows, one funnel row, a schedule.json edit with a new watch item, the cycle log
line, and this note. The two sides now research different rows under different
watch lists: the cloud side has no record of the Hormuz pair, the BTC rungs, the
5y Treasury row, or the Resident Evil trio, and this side has none of the
cloud's Sep 18-19 forecasts. Both runners have now spent about 25.5 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T19:24Z (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 14 / behind 21 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 16 after this tick's
retro and cycle commits). New on origin since the last note: f71329f (cloud
cycle 18:13Z, placed 0 settled 0). This tick reset nothing. It adds one retro
(RETRO-20260919-1925, with a playbook data-point note), seven forecast rows
(two superseding), 300 screener rows, one funnel row, a schedule.json edit with
a new watch item, the cycle log line, and this note. Cost of the split this
hour: the min-cycles guardrail counts FULL lines in the LOCAL `journal/cycles.log`
only, so it forced a FULL cycle here one hour after the last one, while the
cloud side ran its own FULL cycles that this log cannot see. Two runners on two
histories each satisfy the daily minimum separately, which doubles the
screening spend (45 of 150 operator day batches by 19:26Z) for the same pool.
Both runners have now spent about 27 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T20:34Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 16 / behind 23 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 17 after this tick's
cycle commit). New on origin since the last note: dc9e924 (cloud retro) and
702690c (cloud cycle 20:11Z, placed 0 settled 0). This tick reset nothing and
adds only the cycle log line and this note. New cost of the split this hour:
cloud retro dc9e924 graded the same two Sweden vote-share forecast settlements
that local retro fbcffa7 graded at 19:25Z. Each side now writes its own retro
for every shared settlement, so a merge has to pick one retro per event.
Both runners have now spent about 29 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-19T21:36Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 17 / behind 24 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 18 after this tick's
cycle commit). New on origin since the last note: 1bcf110 (cloud triggered
cycle 20:40Z, pricemove:3399197, placed 0 settled 0; it also wrote
journal/watch-state.json and journal/watch-triggers.jsonl; the local copies
of both are still at the merge-base). This tick reset nothing and adds only
the cycle log line and this note. Both runners have now spent about 30 hours
apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-20T21:20Z (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 18 / behind 45 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 19 after this tick's
cycle commit). The operator loop did not tick between 2026-09-19T21:37Z and
now; origin gained 21 commits in that gap (cloud cycles, three retros, the
2026-09-20 deep retro 1ea482e, and four triggered cycles on pricemove:3399197
and pricemove:3938031). This tick reset nothing. It adds eight forecast rows,
300 screener rows, one funnel row, a schedule.json edit with a new watch item,
the cycle log line, and this note. New cost this hour: the cloud side's deep
retro and any playbook edits in it are invisible here, so this cycle ran
election night on a strategy that is two days stale, and both sides will grade
the Sep 20 election bets separately. Both runners have now spent about 53 hours
apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-20T22:33Z (LIGHT tick, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 19 / behind 46 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 20 after this tick's
cycle commit). New on origin since the last note: e27f91e (cloud cycle 22:19Z,
placed 0 settled 0). This tick reset nothing and adds only the cycle log line
and this note. New cost this hour: the collision guard read the cloud tip
(14 min old) and demoted this tick to LIGHT, while local pacing wanted a FULL
cycle (1 FULL line in the local log in the last 24h, min 4). The guard sees
origin's cycles and the pacing count does not, so the two rules now disagree
every time the cloud runner ticks first. Both runners have now spent about 54
hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-21T06:33Z (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 20 / behind 55 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 22 after this tick's
retro and cycle commits). Origin tip cfed7d4 is the 2026-09-21 deep retro; CI
there is green. This tick reset nothing. New cost this hour, and the largest
so far: `resolve.py` settled the Berlin Linke-most bet 7ec71e307f12 (LOST -5.00)
and 13 forecasts on the LOCAL ledger and forecast files. Origin's deep retro
ran at 04:50Z, before the settlement landed, so the cloud runner will settle
the same rows on its next tick with its own `settled_ts`, write its own retro,
and edit the same playbook section. `journal/ledger.jsonl` now differs on both
sides in the same row, and CYCLE.md forbids hand-editing it, so a plain rebase
can no longer succeed even in principle. Suggested operator path: take origin's
`journal/ledger.jsonl` and `journal/forecasts.jsonl` as the base, re-run
`core/resolve.py`, re-record the local-only forecast rows through
`core/forecast.py`, and carry over by hand only `strategy/` and
`journal/retros/` (RETRO-20260921-0633 and the playbook's
price-inside-model-range paragraph are local-only). Both runners have now
spent about 86 hours apart.

**Recurrence 2026-09-21T07:45Z (FULL cycle, operator machine):** still diverged,
ahead 22 / behind 57 at sync, merge-base d0da028 (ahead 24 after this tick's
retro and cycle commits). Origin tip c55f9b3 is the cloud cycle from 06:36Z,
which settled the same Berlin bet on its own ledger copy and wrote its own
retro (8f535ce), as the 06:33Z note predicted. CI on origin is green. This
tick reset nothing. Added cost this hour: one more forecast settlement
(f9e4a2056cec) and six new forecast rows that exist only in the local
`journal/forecasts.jsonl`. The suggested merge path from the 06:33Z note still
applies. Both runners have now spent about 87 hours apart.

## 2026-09-19 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-19.md. No new proposals from
the hourly agent this window; no new operator asks. Statuses:

- **Mech nonce race (2026-09-17): ENDORSED, unchanged, with operator.**
  No recurrence this window.
- **watch.py banned-shape regexes: ENDORSED option (a), open.** Zero
  banned-shape fires this window (all 4 triggers legitimate; the
  tennis new_market fire produced a properly graded forecast). Still
  worth shipping on the three-variants-in-12-days record.
- **Real-twin starvation: open, dated post-Sep-20** (real-ledger still
  56 sweep rows, 0 fills ever).
- **Screener quota refund (2026-09-15): ENDORSED, unchanged, with
  operator.** No failed-tier instance this window.
- **CI funnel-weld (2026-09-14): open, no new instance.**
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner: open, unchanged** (mlb-moneyline
  still best negative forecast cell, -0.0499 n=15).
- **Lease writability: open, unchanged.**
- **fold_brier_delta in counterfactual.py: RE-URGED, final notice** —
  German-bracket veto cluster settles Sep 20; absent the flag,
  DEEP-2026-09-20 does the fold analysis by hand and this ask converts
  to informational.
- **Mech window line (reset 2026-09-14): requests 14, deliveries 13,
  market-aware with context 9 (seen == sent on all 9), paired ma/v4
  sets 4, settled pairs 0.** One settled unpaired ma row (UFO):
  price-shown p_yes beat own, lost to mid; n=1.

**Status:** same five operator asks open as the 2026-09-18 pass
(mech CYCLE.md sentence; real allowed-classes decision post-Sep-20;
watch.py shape regexes; screener quota refund; ODDS_API_KEY), plus the
standing lease/fold-delta/funnel-weld items; everything else
informational.

## 2026-09-20 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-20.md. No new proposals from
the hourly agent this window; one evidence upgrade from the deep retro:

- **CI funnel-weld check (2026-09-14): ENDORSED, RE-URGED — first
  concrete miss.** The 2026-09-19 14:19Z FULL cycle (commit 690f339)
  ran the full funnel (screened=300, escalated=15, 3 forecasts) and
  wrote its funnel summary to cycles.log but NO strategy/funnel.jsonl
  row. Exactly the silent-drop shape the proposal predicted; it now
  has a dated instance. Recommended check: a commit whose cycles.log
  line says "FULL cycle" must touch funnel.jsonl or CI fails.
- **Mech nonce race (2026-09-17): ENDORSED, unchanged, with operator.**
  No mech traffic this window (all cycles cloud, no signer).
- **watch.py banned-shape regexes: ENDORSED option (a), open.** Zero
  banned-shape fires this window; both TRIGGERED fires legitimate.
- **Real-twin starvation: open — decision lands tomorrow** (dated
  post-Sep-20; real-ledger still 56 sweep rows, 0 fills ever).
- **Screener quota refund (2026-09-15): ENDORSED, unchanged, with
  operator.** No failed-tier instance this window.
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner: open, unchanged** (mlb-moneyline
  still best negative forecast cell, -0.0499 n=15 — with the new
  caveat that the mlb-spreads FORECAST cell carries one mis-tagged
  NCAAF row, 32f25ca85db8; see playbook rule added this retro).
- **Lease writability: open, one new dated instance** (14:19Z FULL
  cycle: lease acquired but push refused, ran unprotected).
- **fold_brier_delta in counterfactual.py: final notice CARRIES to
  DEEP-2026-09-21.** Flag verified still absent from core; the
  German-bracket veto cluster it is dated against settles tonight, so
  the by-hand fold analysis (and conversion to informational) falls to
  the first deep retro after settlement — tomorrow, not today.
- **Mech window line (reset 2026-09-14): requests 14, deliveries 13,
  market-aware with context 9 (seen == sent on all 9), paired ma/v4
  sets 4, settled pairs 0.** Unchanged — no signer this window.

**Status:** same five operator asks open as 2026-09-19 (mech CYCLE.md
sentence; real allowed-classes decision — due tomorrow; watch.py shape
regexes; screener quota refund; ODDS_API_KEY), with the funnel-weld CI
ask now carrying its first concrete instance; lease and fold-delta
standing; everything else informational.

## 2026-09-21 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-21.md. No new proposals from
the hourly agent this window. The day's headline: the four
pre-registered election ledger rows did NOT officially resolve, so every
decision gated on them carries with its trigger intact; and the AfD-MV
outside-view-veto forecast (`506bc4c8087e`, est 0.90 vs mkt 0.77)
settled as a CF WIN — graded same-commit, fork recomputed, veto stays.

- **CI funnel-weld check (2026-09-14): ENDORSED, RE-URGED — SECOND
  concrete miss.** The 2026-09-21 04:18Z FULL cycle (commit fb326b5)
  ran the full funnel per its own cycles.log line (scan 810, screened
  300/15, escalated 15) and wrote no strategy/funnel.jsonl row — the
  file ends at the 02:12Z cycle. First miss was 690f339 (2026-09-19
  14:19Z, flagged DEEP-2026-09-20). That is 2 silent drops in the last
  13 FULL cycles. Operator: the check is one line in core CI — a commit
  whose cycles.log line says "FULL cycle" must touch funnel.jsonl or
  fail the push.
- **fold_brier_delta in counterfactual.py: final notice CARRIES again —
  trigger still unfired.** The German-bracket veto cluster it is dated
  against remains unsettled (markets open). Today's deep retro ran the
  by-hand fold recipe anyway for the relaxation-fork status (playbook
  Status 2026-09-21: fold dBrier f3 +0.0323 / f4 +0.0798, fold pnl f4
  −$69.40 — first double-gate failure). Conversion to informational
  happens in the first deep retro after the cluster settles, per the
  standing commitment.
- **Real-twin starvation / allowed-classes decision: CARRIES, trigger
  intact.** Dated post-Sep-20 with the election settlements as input;
  those four rows are still open, so deciding today would be deciding
  without the input the pre-registration named. Real ledger still 56
  sweep rows, 0 fills ever; allowed class cross-market is 1 of 47
  ledger rows (2.6% of paper flow).
- **watch.py banned-shape regexes: ENDORSED option (a), open.** Zero
  banned-shape fires this window (six fires, all legitimate). Related
  hygiene shipped by the hourly agent instead: PCE move_threshold
  0.05→0.10 (ec53056) after three researched no-catalyst fires in
  three days on a 0.01–0.10-spread book — endorsed, KEEP.
- **Mech nonce race (2026-09-17): ENDORSED, unchanged, with operator.**
  No mech traffic this window (all cloud, no signer).
- **Screener quota refund (2026-09-15): ENDORSED, unchanged, with
  operator.** No failed-tier instance; one slow batch (~93s) plus 4
  malformed returns on the 04:18Z cycle, logged, below this proposal's
  bar.
- **ODDS_API_KEY on operator runner: open, unchanged** (mlb-moneyline
  still best negative forecast cell, −0.0499 n=15).
- **Lease writability: open** — every cloud cycle this window acquired
  but could not write the lease and proceeded unprotected; no
  collision this window.
- **Mech window line (reset 2026-09-14):** requests 14, deliveries 13,
  market-aware with context 9 (seen == sent on all 9), paired ma/v4
  sets 4, settled pairs 0. Unchanged.
- **Sep-20 election pre-registrations: STANDING.** Reaffirmed verbatim:
  the four open rows grade as TWO event-night decisions (Russia
  `9074e3f2fd49`+`475edf2e2654`; German `23e40bbbccc5`+`7ec71e307f12`);
  the empirical-sd fit runs on all settled vote-share rows in the retro
  that settles the German brackets; the retro that grades them also
  closes the real-twin decision and the fold-delta conversion.

**Status:** same five operator asks open (mech CYCLE.md sentence; real
allowed-classes — trigger pending settlement; watch.py shape regexes;
screener quota refund; ODDS_API_KEY), funnel-weld CI ask now at TWO
dated instances and re-urged; lease and fold-delta standing; everything
else informational.

## 2026-09-21 11:2xZ - mech clause parser cuts mid-sentence on titles without "Will" (informational, mech side)

Request `phil-20260921-1130-wti91-ma-21` (service 21, market-aware, market 4683872). The prompt followed CYCLE.md 5a:
one resolution sentence, then the market question as a single sentence ending in `?` ("WTI Crude Oil (WTI) closes above
$91 on September 21?"). The delivery reports `parse_tier: clause`, but the serper query was "is strictly higher than 91
US dollars, and No otherwise. The market closes at 2026-09-21 22:00 UTC. WTI Crude Oil (WTI) closes above $91 on
September" - the tail of my resolution sentence plus a truncated title. Titles that do not open with Will/Is/Does seem
to defeat the clause extractor, and the tier label does not show it. Second, smaller: on all three questions today
(BTC reach, ETH dip, WTI close) the answer is spot plus vol and no delivery retrieved a live quote; market-aware
recovered most of that from the supplied price on BTC and ETH, and ignored the price on WTI (p_independent 0.98 =
p_yes 0.98 vs 0.933 seen) where its quote was the expiring Oct contract on roll day. No ask on my side; the rows are
in `journal/mech-requests.jsonl` for the mech team.

## 2026-09-21 13:3xZ - two LIGHT ticks in one minute diverge on a single `settled_ts` field (operator machine)

**Evidence:** at this tick's step 0 (13:26Z, not shallow) local main was ahead 2 / behind 1, merge-base `4e25d5a`.
Local-only: `4f36845` (RETRO-20260921-1224 plus its playbook edit) and `ef93628`. Origin-only: `2357f95`. Both tips
are `cycle: 20260921-1226` commits: the cloud runner and this machine each ran a LIGHT tick at 12:26Z, one hour after
the operator's manual merge. `work/divdiff_0921.py` compares `journal/forecasts.jsonl` on both sides by id: same 973
ids, one differing field in total - row `423dd881047b`, `settled_ts` 12:23:22Z local against 12:24:38Z origin. Every
other touched file is union-merged (`.gitattributes`), so that one wall-clock stamp is the whole reason loop.sh's
`git pull --rebase` stopped and left the commits local. This tick reset nothing, ran LIGHT on local state, and settled
two more forecasts (`4c12ab5dc28e`, `5ece5e87793d`) that the cloud will settle again with its own stamps, so the
conflict is now three lines.

**Cause:** the lease and the tip guard protect FULL cycles. A LIGHT tick is what a runner does when it is told to
stand down, so nothing stops two LIGHT ticks in the same minute, and any tick that settles a forecast rewrites a row
in place with `now` (`core/resolve.py` lines 52 and 60). Two honest runners settling the same row can never produce
identical bytes.

**Ask (either one removes this class):** (a) stamp `settled_ts` from the market's own close or resolution time
instead of the wall clock, so both runners write the same line and git sees no conflict; or (b) add a merge driver
for `forecasts.jsonl` that unions by `id` and prefers the settled row with the earlier `settled_ts` - the same rule
the operator's manual merge applied on 2026-09-21. **Repair today:** rebase local onto origin and take either side
for the three settled rows (they differ only in `settled_ts`); keep RETRO-20260921-1224, RETRO-20260921-1330 and
both playbook edits, which origin lacks.

## 2026-09-21 14:1xZ - wire-nonce 401 also hits SEQUENTIAL mech sends; first R1 tool findings (informational, mech side)

**Nonce.** Request `phil-20260921-1428-nk3-r1fs-44` (service 44, off-chain) was rejected before payment with "wire
nonce below sender's next expected slot (HTTP 401)". The 2026-09-17 note blamed two PARALLEL sends. This one was
sequential: it went out about a minute after `phil-20260921-1426-nk3-r1ma-44` had delivered on the same mech. A retry
with a new request id delivered at once. So the sender-side nonce can lag a completed off-chain request. **Ask:** have
Pearl Connect re-read the expected slot (or retry once internally) on this 401, and add the wire-nonce 401 to CYCLE.md
5a's list of transient errors next to EIP-1271 / HTTP 503, since today I applied that retry rule by analogy.

**R1 tools, first cycle (six R1 deliveries plus one GPT-4.1 baseline, three questions, rows in `journal/mech-requests.jsonl`).**
1. R1 market-aware ignored the supplied price on two of three rows: Opus-on-Sep-21 `p_independent` 0.15 = `p_yes` 0.15
   with `market_prob_seen` 0.806, North Korea exactly-3 0.30 = 0.30 with 0.398 seen. GPT-4.1 market-aware on the
   identical North Korea inputs moved 0.36 -> 0.39. On the Quebec row R1 did move (0.75 -> 0.85 with 0.895 seen).
2. R1 blind and R1 market-aware disagree with each other by 0.60 on Quebec PQ-most-seats before any price is applied
   (blind 0.15, market-aware `p_independent` 0.75). The blind run fetched 5 sources and no poll tracker; its page bodies
   were the Wikipedia infobox with the 2022 seat counts and two empty pages, and it appears to have read 2022 as now.
3. `research_class` NR-numeric / researchability 0.2 on a dated product-release question (Opus) is a misclass; the
   reason text talks about "numeric data about release dates".
4. A Polymarket event-page AI summary was a page body on 5 of the 7 deliveries (all three North Korea, both Quebec),
   blind ones included; on the Opus market-aware row the top page was the PM event page rules text. The summaries carry
   trader-consensus language and sometimes odds, so the blind tool is not blind when the market question is the query.
5. Reported model cost: 0.0007-0.0009 USD per R1 request against 0.0243 for GPT-4.1, at the same 0.01 USDC price.
No ask on my side beyond the nonce item.

## 2026-09-21 17:4xZ - R1 tools, second cycle; mech deliveries are the binding context cost (informational, mech side)

1. **R1 market-aware ignored the price again.** Request `phil-20260921-1735-opus22-r1ma-s21`: `p_independent` 0.20 =
   `p_yes` 0.20 with `market_prob_seen` 0.63. That is 3 of 4 R1 market-aware rows where the price moved nothing. GPT-4.1
   on identical inputs (`phil-20260921-1739-opus22-ma41-s21`) moved 0.06 -> 0.18.
2. **Possible format-example anchor.** Both R1 outputs on this question were p_yes 0.2, p_no 0.8, confidence 0.7. The
   blind tool's OUTPUT_FORMAT block shows exactly `"p_yes": 0.2, "p_no": 0.8, "confidence": 0.7` as its example. 2 of
   9 R1 rows now sit on that triple (the mechlog note on the blind row says 2 of 10, a miscount), both from this one
   question, where retrieval found nothing useful. **Ask:** change the
   example values in the prompt (or remove the numbers) and see whether empty-evidence answers move.
3. **NR-numeric on a dated release, again.** Same misclass as the Sep 21 leg this morning. GPT-4.1 classed it R, 0.85.
4. **Delivery size.** Each delivery returns the full prompt, the Serper response and the page bodies, about 15k tokens.
   This cycle I ran the mech step on one of four candidates because of it. **Ask (Pearl Connect):** an option on
   `mech_request` to return `result` and `metadata.params` without `prompt` and `source_content`, so the
   every-candidate rule in CYCLE.md 5a is affordable.

## 2026-09-21 20:5xZ - R1 tools, third cycle: the retrieval layer decides the answer (informational, mech side)

Seven requests, seven deliveries, all off-chain first try. Request ids are in `journal/mech-requests.jsonl`.

1. **The search query is the first 140 to 150 characters of the prompt.** On `phil-20260921-2100-opus22b-r1ma-s21`
   and its blind twin the query ended at "available to", before my date, and the results were the Opus 5 and Opus 4.5
   launch posts. On the Musk pair the week fell off the same way and the results were other weeks' event pages. I now
   front-load the date (playbook rule, this commit). **Ask:** build the query from the whole question sentence, or
   from extracted entities plus the date, so a long precise question is not punished.
2. **Only the top 5 organic results reach the model.** On `phil-20260921-2052-btc90k-r1fs-s44` the one on-point
   source (CoinGlass snippet, BTC 86,159.50, +6.32 pct) sat at rank 8. The model answered 0.10 on a barrier 4 pct from
   spot. **Ask:** for price-threshold questions, fetch one live quote, or pass all 10 snippets.
3. **Retrieval is not repeatable, so the GPT-4.1 baseline is confounded.** Same query 50 seconds later
   (`phil-20260921-2054-btc90k-ma41-s44`) ranked the live Binance price at 4 and 5. GPT-4.1 answered 0.565, the R1
   pair 0.30 and 0.10. I cannot attribute that gap to the model. **Ask:** an option to pin one retrieval across a
   pair or trio (cache by query for a few minutes), so paired rows compare models on identical evidence.
4. **R1 market-aware ignored the price a fourth time.** `phil-20260921-2100-opus22b-r1ma-s21`: `p_independent` 0.10 =
   `p_yes` 0.10 at `market_prob_seen` 0.732, with its own `evidence_quality` at 0.1. The ORDER OF WORK text says the
   final answer should move where the price carries facts the sources lack. It moved on the other two (0.20 -> 0.30
   toward 0.5655; 0.60 -> 0.55 toward 0.495). The shown-price answer landed BELOW the blind twin (0.10 vs 0.15).
5. **Class labels.** R1 called the Musk post count `NR-sports` with the reason "which is a non-sports event" and
   researchability 0.9; the BTC barrier `NR-numeric` at 0.8 (GPT-4.1: `NR-price`, 0.12); the dated Opus release
   `NR-numeric` at 0.2 for the third time. The class and the number disagree with each other on two of three.
6. **`[... evidence truncated ...]` appeared in the Opus market-aware prompt while `scan_truncated` was false.** If
   those are different truncations, a second flag would help.

## 2026-09-22 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-22.md. Statuses set this
pass on the four items filed since the 09-21 pass:

- **settled_ts wall-clock divergence on twin LIGHT ticks (2026-09-21
  13:3xZ): ENDORSED — option (a) preferred** (stamp `settled_ts` from
  the market's own close/resolution time in core/resolve.py, so two
  honest runners write identical bytes; option (b)'s merge driver
  treats the symptom). Operator: core/resolve.py is yours. This is the
  fourth infra item in a month whose root cause is a per-runner wall
  clock on a shared row (`noticed_ts` was removed for exactly this on
  2026-09-21); (a) removes the class.
- **wire-nonce 401 on sequential mech sends (2026-09-21 14:1xZ):
  ENDORSED** — both halves (Pearl Connect re-reads the expected slot or
  retries internally; CYCLE.md 5a lists the 401 as transient next to
  EIP-1271/503). Operator ask; the agent already applies the retry by
  analogy and it has worked every time (n=2).
- **mech delivery-size option (2026-09-21 17:4xZ): ENDORSED** (return
  `result` + `metadata.params` without `prompt`/`source_content`).
  The every-candidate rule in CYCLE.md 5a is currently unaffordable at
  ~15k tokens per delivery — this is the binding constraint on the R1
  record the operator asked for on 2026-09-21, so it is worth relaying
  to Pearl Connect promptly.
- **R1 retrieval findings (2026-09-21 20:5xZ): informational,
  no status needed** — the asks are mech-side (query construction,
  top-5 cutoff, retrieval pinning for paired sends). The agent-side
  mitigation (front-load the date) is already a playbook rule.

New this pass:

- **counterfactual.py subclass auto-tagger mislabel (minor, operator).**
  Row `8601f47e8b85` (Berlin Grüne 14-17%, a self-modeled Gaussian
  bracket per its own note) is auto-tagged `fact-finality`
  (RETRO-20260922-0415 flagged it, not acted on). 95 of 151 veto rows
  get no sub-class at all, so sub-class cuts of the CF ledger are
  currently unreliable for rulings — nothing gates on them today, but
  the relaxation-fork post-mortems quote them. Low priority; a
  reconcile pass or a note-side label convention both work.

Carried, triggers intact:

- **Real-twin allowed-classes decision + fold_brier_delta conversion:
  CARRY.** The German half of the Sep-20 pre-registration is now
  settled and graded (both legs lost, −$10, RETRO-20260921-1625 audited
  and endorsed today); the Russia pair (`9074e3f2fd49` marked 0.992 vs
  0.68 entry, `475edf2e2654`) is still open on UMA lag, and deciding on
  half the named input would be deciding without it. First deep retro
  after the Russia settlements discharges both.
- **Funnel-weld CI check: RE-URGED, unchanged at 2 dated misses in 13
  FULL cycles.** One line in core CI.
- **ODDS_API_KEY on runners: RE-URGED** — mlb-moneyline is now the
  book's best cell (−0.0499, n=15) and remains starved of a benchmark.
- **Lease writability, screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes,
  mech CYCLE.md sentence: open, unchanged, with operator.**

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (7th consecutive, 2nd double-gate
failure — status line in playbook); zero bets placed this window, no
floor tested; no reverts of hourly edits; the day's read is in
DEEP-2026-09-22.md §(a): the classes that beat the market are all
forecast-only behind pre-registered triggers, and the job is to land
the triggers, not jump them.

## 2026-09-23 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-23.md. No new proposals
were filed by the hourly agent this window; the 2026-09-22 20:15Z
retro's reconcile-drift flag was the one open handoff and is resolved
as follows.

New this pass:

- **counterfactual.py reconcile is units-blind and B-check-narrow
  (operator, core/counterfactual.py).** Evidence from today's full
  run: (i) ~60 of its 71 "C. rows in both that differ" are the units
  convention (hand tables record CF P&L in dollars at the $5 flat
  stake; reconcile prints 1u = pnl/5 and diffs the raw numbers — hand
  `-5.00` vs ledger `-1.00u` is the same value), which buries the ~10
  genuine early-era mid-vs-ask edge quotes and fill-model refusals;
  its "hand table -65.20u" totals line sums dollars as units and is
  meaningless as printed. Ask: compare in one unit. (ii) The B-check
  ("settled rows the hand table never entered") scans only
  outside-view-veto — the two wide-spread-veto gaps repaired on
  2026-09-22 (one dating to 2026-08-19) were invisible to it. Ask:
  extend B to every skip_reason with a hand table. Agent-side half is
  done: the 9 outside-view-veto B-list rows are backfilled
  (documentation-only REPAIR, playbook, this commit; totals unchanged)
  and the units convention is now written into the playbook CF
  section so no future reader mistakes it for drift.

Re-urged with new evidence:

- **Funnel-weld CI check: THIRD dated instance.** The 2026-09-22
  08:23Z FULL cycle scanned ("Screener 300/300 in 15 haiku batches",
  cycles.log:1341) and wrote no strategy/funnel.jsonl row. Three
  silent drops in ~15 FULL cycles; one CI line (every FULL cycle
  commit must add a funnel row) closes the class.
- **ODDS_API_KEY on runners:** unchanged; mlb-moneyline (−0.0499,
  n=15) still the best cell in the book and still benchmark-starved
  on cloud.

Carried, triggers intact:

- **Real-twin allowed-classes + fold_brier_delta conversion: CARRY.**
  Russia pair (9074e3f2fd49, 475edf2e2654) still open on UMA lag,
  marks 0.988/0.994. First deep retro after settlement discharges
  both.
- **settled_ts determinism (option a), wire-nonce 401 + CYCLE.md
  sentence, mech delivery-size option: ENDORSED 2026-09-22,
  unchanged, with operator/Pearl Connect.**
- **Lease writability, screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes,
  subclass auto-tagger mislabel: open, unchanged, with operator.**

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (8th consecutive, 3rd double-gate
failure; f4 CF pnl deepened to −$59.74 — status line in playbook);
zero bets placed this window, no floor tested, zero settlement-grading
misses; no reverts of hourly edits (the R1-protocol encoding and the
NRFI either-side screener trap note were the window's best edits);
touch-family 6th measured row lands within the week — the job is
still to land the triggers, not jump them.


## 2026-09-23 15:1xZ (FULL cycle, operator machine): mech signer out of POL gas

Operator act needed. The first 5 mech requests this cycle delivered off-chain,
then the mech prepaid balance ran out. mech_request auto-deposit sends a Safe
transaction to top it up, and it failed 3 times with "insufficient funds for gas
* price + value: balance 0.1404 POL, tx cost ~0.158 POL". Until the signer holds
more POL (or the mech balance is topped up another way), every mech request on
this runner fails before sending, and the R1 evaluation (CYCLE.md 5a) stalls.
Request ids: phil-20260923-1500-{4052500,4871569,4871586}-ma-r1, all logged in
journal/mech-requests.jsonl with --error.

Status: ENDORSED (operator act) — DEEP-2026-09-24. Still failing: the
2026-09-24T01:40Z FULL cycle's request (market 4867959) hit the same
error (balance 0.1404 POL, tx cost ~0.160 POL). That makes 4 failed
requests over ~11h and no R1 triples since 2026-09-23 15:05Z, so the
operator's daily sample-of-3 (2026-09-21 21:25Z note) is not being met.
The agent cannot fix this: it needs POL on the signer or a manual mech
top-up.

## 2026-09-24 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-24.md.

Hourly-agent proposals this window: one, the mech POL-gas ask above,
now ENDORSED.

Re-urged with new evidence:

- **Funnel-weld CI check: now 4-5 dated instances in ONE day.** The
  screener quota proves 10 screened FULLs ran on UTC 2026-09-23
  (day_batches reached 150/150 = 10 x 15 at the 14:30Z row), but only 6
  funnel rows carry that day's screened cycles. cycles.log FULL entries
  with a "Funnel: scanned ... screened 300" clause and no matching
  funnel.jsonl row: 2026-09-23 08:24Z (operator), 11:38Z (operator),
  12:45Z (cloud), and 2026-09-24 01:42Z (operator). The cycle writes the
  funnel numbers into cycles.log and then leaves out the jsonl row,
  mostly on the operator runner (3 of 4). A drop rate of ~40% makes
  funnel.jsonl useless as the sensing record. One CI line (a FULL-cycle
  commit must add a funnel.jsonl row), or core/scan.py writing the row
  itself, closes it. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **ODDS_API_KEY: missing on the operator runner as well.** The
  2026-09-23 15:00Z operator-runner funnel row says the MLB slate (15
  games) was skipped because the odds key is not provisioned on the
  operator runner. So the book's best cell (mlb-moneyline) cannot get a
  benchmark on EITHER runner. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **Screener quota vs two runners (operator, config/core):** the 150/day
  batch quota is shared by the cloud and operator loops, which both run
  FULL cycles. On 2026-09-23 it ran out at 14:30Z, and the evening went
  unscreened until 01:42Z. The agent-side fix is in
  schedule.json `screener_budget` (this commit). Operator options: raise
  the quota, or give each runner its own share. Status: PROPOSED
  (operator), low priority now that pacing budgets it.

Carried unchanged: counterfactual.py reconcile units/B-check
(2026-09-23), real-twin allowed-classes (Russia pair 9074e3f2fd49 /

determinism, wire-nonce 401, mech delivery-size, lease writability,
screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (9th consecutive, 4th double-gate
failure; f4 CF pnl −$69.74). Touch family re-graded at 7 decisions: own
closer on 2, so the 10-decision promotion bar can no longer be met, and
it drops from research priority 1. Zero bets placed in the window. No
reverts of hourly edits.

## 2026-09-25 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-25.md.

Hourly-agent proposals this window: none new.

Re-urged / escalated with new evidence:

- **Mech + Pearl Connect: escalated from "out of POL gas" to "tools
  absent".** Since the 2026-09-24 01:40Z failure, every operator-runner
  FULL cycle (10:06Z, 13:25Z, 15:35Z, 17:35Z, 19:49Z, 23:10Z, 01:11Z,
  03:24Z) logs "no pearl-connect mech tools in this session", and every
  operator cycle runs in paper mode. No mech request has been attempted
  for ~27h and none has delivered since 2026-09-23 15:05Z (~37h), so the
  operator's daily R1 sample-of-3 has been missed two days running, and
  no real twin can be placed either (real-ledger: zero fills, last row
  2026-09-09). Operator act: restore the Pearl Connect MCP tools on the
  operator runner (PEARL_CONNECT_STORE / .mcp.json), and fund the signer
  with POL. Status: ENDORSED (operator act), priority raised.
- **Funnel-weld CI check: 1 instance this window (was 4-5).** The
  2026-09-24 10:06Z operator FULL logged "Funnel: scanned 1000, screened
  300" in cycles.log with no funnel.jsonl row; the other 8 screened FULLs
  in the window have rows. Better, still not closed by construction.
  Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- **ODDS_API_KEY on both runners:** unchanged, 4 `benchmark-unreachable`
  skips this window. Status: PROPOSED (operator).

Carried unchanged: screener quota vs two runners (low priority; the
agent-side `screener_budget` rule worked this window, see retro),
counterfactual.py reconcile units/B-check, real-twin allowed-classes
(Russia pair still on UMA lag, marks 0.97/0.996), settled_ts
determinism, wire-nonce 401, mech delivery-size, lease writability,
screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (10th consecutive, 5th double-gate
failure; f4 dBrier +0.0277, f4 CF pnl −$0.40). 4 bets placed, 3 settled
WON (+$4.05), 1 open. No reverts of hourly edits.

## 2026-09-26 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-26.md.

Hourly-agent proposals this window: none new.

- **Mech + Pearl Connect (ESCALATED, carried):** every FULL since
  2026-09-24 01:40Z still logs "no mcp__pearl-connect__mech_* tools".
  ~51h without a mech attempt, R1 daily sample missed 3 days running,
  no real twins possible. Status: ENDORSED (operator act).
- **NEW, informational: operator runner silent since 2026-09-25
  17:35Z** (~11h at retro time). The cloud runner held the 2h FULL
  cadence alone, so nothing was lost; check the machine if the gap was
  not an intentional shutdown. Status: INFORMATIONAL.
- **Funnel-weld CI check:** 2026-09-25 05:31Z operator FULL has no
  funnel.jsonl row; the 12:16Z FULL wrote none either and was
  hand-backfilled by the 14:21Z cycle. Status: PROPOSED (operator),
  re-urged.
- **ODDS_API_KEY on both runners:** mlb-moneyline forecasts have not
  grown since 09-16 (n=15, the best-delta cell on the promising list is
  starved); Slovakia-Moldova skipped for no key at 04:11Z. Status:
  PROPOSED (operator), re-urged.

Carried unchanged: screener quota vs two runners, counterfactual.py
per-fold dBrier column (still computed by hand every day),
real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce 401, mech
delivery-size, lease writability, screener quota refund, watch.py shape
regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (11th consecutive; gate 2 now holds,
gate 1 fails, f4 dBrier +0.0363). 0 bets placed, 3 settled WON (+$4.43),
4 open. No reverts; one consolidation rule (unmeasured shades) and a
research-allocation re-rank capping social-media-postcount.

## 2026-09-27 — deep-retro status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-27.md.

Hourly-agent proposals this window: none new.

- **Mech + Pearl Connect (ESCALATED, carried):** last mech-requests row
  still "insufficient POL for gas (0.1404 POL, tx ~0.160) ... prepaid
  mech balance exhausted". R1 daily sample missed 4 days running; no
  real twins possible. Operator runner is back up (23:49Z Sep 26), so
  the fix is topping up the service safe with POL. Status: ENDORSED
  (operator act).
- **Operator runner silent (09-26 informational):** ticks resumed
  2026-09-26 23:49Z. Status: RESOLVED.
- **NEW (operator, core/counterfactual.py): exclude refusal rows from
  the brier_delta column (or print a second column without them).** A
  bid-only/ask-only mid is not a market probability; f7fcd3a05a31
  (quake, no ask, bid-only mid 0.36) alone moved wide-spread-veto
  dBrier -0.0279 -> -0.0444. PnL already excludes refusals; dBrier
  should match. Status: PROPOSED (operator).
- Funnel-weld CI check; ODDS_API_KEY on both runners: PROPOSED
  (operator), carried.

Carried unchanged: screener quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier
column, real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce
401, mech delivery-size, lease writability, screener quota refund,
watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (12th; f4 fold pnl -3.34 after
MrBeast pair). 0 bets placed, 0 settled, 4 open (RBA No effectively
lost). No reverts; two playbook hygiene rules.

## DEEP-2026-09-28 status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-28.md.

Hourly-agent proposals this window: none new.

- **Mech + Pearl Connect (ESCALATED, carried):** last mech-requests row
  2026-09-24T01:40Z, still "insufficient POL for gas ... prepaid mech
  balance exhausted". R1 sample missed 5 days running. Status: ENDORSED
  (operator act: top up the service safe with POL).
- **NEW informational: operator runner silent again.** Last
  operator-machine tick in cycles.log is 2026-09-27T06:12Z (~22h); all
  ticks since are cloud. Paper learning unaffected; mech/real paths
  cannot run. Status: INFORMATIONAL.
- **Refusal-row dBrier column (core/counterfactual.py):** PROPOSED
  (operator), carried.
- Funnel-weld CI check; ODDS_API_KEY on both runners: PROPOSED
  (operator), carried.

Carried unchanged: screener quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier
column, real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce
401, mech delivery-size, lease writability, screener quota refund,
watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (13th; no OVV settlements). 1 bet
placed (quake <=6, count closed at 4 -> WON pending resolution), 0
settled, 5 open. No reverts; 11 graded watch items archived out of
schedule.json.

## 2026-09-28 12:2xZ - mech gas: the top-up target is the agent EOA, not the safe (FULL cycle, operator machine)

- **Correction to the ENDORSED mech item.** `wallet_info` now shows the
  polygon service safe at 15 POL, so the "top up the service safe"
  act has happened, but the mech path still fails the same way:
  `insufficient funds for gas * price + value: balance
  140390720573003474, tx cost 158856982804685966` (request
  phil-20260928-1235-4903419-ma-r1). That balance, 0.1404 POL, is the
  **agent EOA** (`0x3C79...1bAD`), which pays gas for the auto-deposit
  Safe transaction. Fix: send at least ~0.5 POL to the agent EOA (a few
  deposits' worth), or pre-fund the mech prepaid balance from the safe.
  Status: PROPOSED (operator act). R1 sample missed 6 days running.

## DEEP-2026-09-29 status pass

Full detail in journal/retros/DEEP-2026-09-29.md.

- **2026-09-28 12:2xZ mech gas → agent EOA:** ENDORSED. Last
  mech-requests row: "safe holds 15 POL but EOA pays gas (0.1404 POL, tx
  ~0.159)". Operator act: send ~0.5 POL to the agent EOA. R1 sample
  missed 7 days. Status: ENDORSED (operator act).
- **NEW (operator, core/screen.py, conditional):** reserve 1-2 escalation
  slots per FULL for high-liquidity divergence-0 `low` rows whose reason
  names a specific missing data source. The Parcl family was screened
  362x over 14 days, always "need data", and never escalated; 38% of
  screened rows since Sep 22 have this shape. The agent-side rotating
  validated-feed sweep (playbook) is tested first. Status: PROPOSED
  (operator), conditional on the 2026-10-06 sweep retirement test.
- Carried unchanged: refusal-row dBrier column, funnel-weld CI check,
  ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener quota vs two runners, per-fold
  dBrier column, real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism,
  wire-nonce 401, mech delivery-size, lease writability, screener quota
  refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger.

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (14th). 1 bet settled (quake WON
+0.62), 3 placed (Parcl trio), 7 open. No reverts; validated-feed sweep
and first-contact family cap added.

## 2026-09-29 05:1xZ - mech step: undelivered off-chain send, then wire-nonce 401 x2 (evidence for the open EOA-gas and wire-nonce items)

- Off-chain R1 market-aware request phil-20260929-0512-airename-r1aware (mech id 2357e3b9...011d, service 21) was accepted, then not delivered in the 300s wait or one 240s mech_result poll.
- The next two sequential off-chain sends on service 21 got HTTP 401 "wire nonce below sender's next expected slot". The undelivered request may hold the slot.
- The legacy_on_chain fallback was not tried: the agent EOA was last logged at 0.1404 POL against ~0.13-0.16 POL per tx. Operator act still open: send ~0.5 POL to the agent EOA, and check whether the undelivered request was paid.
- **Status (DEEP-2026-09-30):** ENDORSED as evidence. It adds to the open EOA-gas (~0.5 POL to the agent EOA) and wire-nonce 401 items. No new ask. The R1 daily sample has now missed 8 days.

## 2026-09-29 18:0xZ - LIGHT ticks defer forecast-settlement grading: CYCLE.md step 3 and the LIGHT definition read as permitting it

- Evidence: two cloud LIGHT ticks today settled rows and deferred grading to "the next FULL cycle". At 14:55Z it was the Canada GDP bet 05333272be9d, graded 70 minutes late in RETRO-20260929-1545. At 16:15Z it was 5 JOLTS forecasts, graded about 2h late in RETRO-20260929-1800. Earlier instances are on record: DEEP-2026-08-05 (b21e42c123a1, 23h late) and DEEP-2026-09-02 (2 forecasts, 19h late).
- Cause: CYCLE.md step 3 says "only if new positions settled", which reads as ledger-only. The LIGHT tick definition says "step 1 and the open-position monitor only". The agent-side rule that overrides both lives in the schedule.json `_comment`, a 69KB file, and gets missed.
- Ask (operator text): (a) step 3: "only if new positions OR forecasts settled since the last retro"; (b) LIGHT definition: "step 1, step 3 if step 1 settled anything, and the open-position monitor".

## 2026-09-30 22:1xZ - subclass auto-tagger: window bleed fakes a met carve-out bar (evidence for the carried item)

- Evidence: `core/counterfactual.py ledger --skip-reason outside-view-veto` prints "pre-registered carve-out bar for countable-metric: MET". The group includes the Alibaba best-Chinese-model row (+$66.43, dBrier -0.45), which is a leaderboard question. `label_subclasses` found "countable-metric" in a section heading of RETRO-20260930-1857 within the 600-character `RETRO_WINDOW` of that row's id, and countable-metric is checked first.
- Corrected by hand (RETRO-20260930-2210): 5 rows, 4 events, +$20.57, one event carries the bar. The agent ruled NOT activated.
- Ask (operator, core/counterfactual.py): label from the forecast note first, and fall back to retro prose only on an explicit tag next to the id (for example `subclass: countable-metric`), or else use the nearest sub-class mention in the same paragraph. Until then the MET line cannot be trusted without a manual row check.

## 2026-10-01 08:3xZ - counterfactual ledger reconcile backlog: table rows and a parser-level total mismatch

- Evidence: while doing the mandatory same-commit table extension for this tick's settled outside-view-veto/wide-spread-veto rows (RETRO-20261001-0836), `core/counterfactual.py reconcile` reported 19 settled outside-view-veto ledger rows the hand-kept playbook table never entered. 5 were genuinely absent (including `ce1f37ed95c0` NVIDIA, backfilled this tick); the other 14 go back to at least 2026-09-17 and were graded narratively in their own retros but never added as table rows, a formatting debt the DEEP-2026-08-23 same-commit rule was meant to prevent.
- Also: the reconcile tool's own parser check reports its row-matched total does not re-sum to the table's last stated total, and separately flags 97 rows where its recomputed edge/pnl differs from the hand-entered value (many look like known, already-documented issues such as the Astra misquote from RETRO-20260904-2215, some may be real drift, and the parser itself may have matching/unit limitations - not disentangled here).
- Not hand-fixed this tick: auditing 14 historical rows plus 97 flagged differences is a multi-hour reconciliation pass, not LIGHT-tick-scoped work, and attempting it piecemeal risks introducing new arithmetic errors.
- Ask (operator): a dedicated backfill/reconcile pass (deep-retro scale) that (a) enters the 14 missing historical rows, (b) resolves or explains the parser's total-mismatch and the 97 flagged diffs, and (c) considers whether `core/counterfactual.py reconcile` should become the source of truth for this table instead of a hand-kept narrative log, since the hand-kept table has now visibly drifted at least twice (this entry, and the countable-metric mislabel above).

## 2026-10-01 18:1xZ - local and cloud main diverged 43 commits each way for over 24h

- Evidence: this operator-machine FULL cycle found local `main` (tip `f16fe61`, last cycle 20261001-1708) and `origin/main` (tip `823577f`, last cycle 20261001-1742) had diverged at `git merge-base` `f7303c0`, which both sides' logs place around 2026-09-30 00:22Z-00:35Z. Both sides ran roughly one cycle commit per hour independently since then with no shared history for over a day -- two separate forking ledgers/journals, not a brief blip like the 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-21 incidents in `phil-local-loop-setup` memory.
- Per CYCLE.md step 0 I logged this and continued on local state rather than reset; a manual repair (the forecasts-union pattern from the 2026-09-21 fix) is operator work, not something this cycle should attempt mid-run.
- Ask (operator): run the repair merge (forecasts union by id preferring settled rows, watch items/price moves/schedule.json/playbook/proposals merged by the established pattern) before more divergence accumulates, and check why the gap went unnoticed for a full day -- loop.sh's collision guard and lease only protect a single commit window, not a standing multi-day fork between two always-on runners.

## 2026-10-02 02:5xZ - same fork, still unrepaired, now ~2.5 days and ~50 commits each side

- Evidence: same `git merge-base` `f7303c0` (2026-09-29 23:47Z) as the 2026-10-01 18:1xZ entry above. Local tip is now `7285d16` (cycle 20261002-0149), origin/main tip is now `f2e1f68` (cycle 20261002-0235) -- the fork has simply kept growing since the last report, unrepaired. No new cause found; this is a status bump, not new evidence. PHIL_LEASE and PHIL_PUSH_BY_LOOP are both set this tick, so the lease mechanism is active on this runner but clearly isn't preventing the standing fork on the other side.
- Ask (operator): same repair as above, now overdue -- the two ledgers/journals have been diverging for 2.5 days.

## 2026-10-02 06:0xZ - same fork, still unrepaired

- Evidence: same `git merge-base` `f7303c0` (2026-09-29 23:47Z). Local tip is now `0eb105b` (cycle 20261002-0503), origin/main tip is now `c8ffe3f` (cycle(triggered) 20261002-0527) -- fork has kept growing, still unrepaired since the first report at 2026-10-01 18:1xZ. Status bump only.
- Ask (operator): same repair as above, now ~2.75 days overdue.

## 2026-10-03 - Open bet past its end date with no resolution (operator)

- Evidence: ledger row e746d7e1ba99 (Andersson "next PM of Sweden", No, entry
  0.21, $5) has end_date 2026-09-13T00:00Z and is still open on 2026-10-03,
  about 20 days later. resolve.py reports it as still open each cycle.
- Public reporting (Euronews and The Star, 2026-09-28) says Andersson gave up
  forming a government and Kristersson was next, so the outcome looks
  determined. The gap seems to be the official resolution source, not the
  market.
- Cause (protected path): core/resolve.py has no path that settles a bet whose
  end date passed without an official resolution. The position ties up cash and
  will keep showing as open in the monitor.
- Ask (operator): decide how a past-end-date market with no official resolution
  should settle (e.g. a timeout or manual settle). The agent cannot change this.

## 2026-10-03 06:40Z - correction: the 48h void branch in resolve.py is unreachable (cause for the stale open bet)

- Correction to the entry above. core/resolve.py does have a settle path for
  past-end-date markets: `VOID_GRACE_HOURS = 48` (line 26) and a void branch
  (lines 90-93) that marks a row "void" with pnl 0 once the end date is more
  than 48h old. The branch is never reached for these markets, because
  `settle_against_market` returns False first when gamma does not report the
  market as closed (line 76: `if not m.get("closed"): return False`).
- Evidence: gamma market 1193094 (the Sweden PM bet) on 2026-10-03 reports
  `closed: false`, `active: true`, `endDate: 2026-09-14T03:59Z`, prices
  0.815 Yes / 0.185 No. Our row's end_date (2026-09-13) is 20 days past the
  48h grace, so the void branch should fire, but the early return blocks it.
- Scale: 1 bet row and 31 forecast rows in the ledger and forecasts files are
  open with end dates more than 48h ago. The forecast rows include the
  Tallahassee and St. Petersburg mayoral markets (end 2026-08-18) and the
  WNBA MVP market (end 2026-09-25), so this is not one market.
- Cause (protected path, core/resolve.py): the void check sits behind the
  closed check. Either the void branch should run for past-grace markets
  whether or not gamma has closed them, or the operator should decide the
  settlement rule for stale-active markets (the earlier entry's question).
- Ask (operator): decide the rule. The agent cannot edit core/resolve.py. The
  bet's $5 remains tied up until then; no edit by the agent is appropriate.

## 2026-10-05 02:5xZ - same fork, still unrepaired, now ~5.9 days and 80-100+ commits each side

- Evidence: same `git merge-base` `f7303c0` (2026-09-29 23:47:44Z) as every
  entry above since 2026-10-01 18:1xZ. Local tip is now `2005f85` (cycle
  20261005-0250, 86 commits since merge-base), origin/main tip is now
  `9a90d7f` (cycle 20261005-0236, 100 commits since merge-base). Last status
  bump was 2026-10-02 06:0xZ at ~2.75 days / ~50 commits each side; the fork
  has more than doubled in size since then with no repair in between. No new
  cause found beyond the 2026-09-18 21:46Z entry (lease is write-protected
  from the cloud side, loop.sh never auto-merges) -- status bump only, but
  the gap between bumps (3 days) is itself a signal that per-cycle status
  bumps are not getting operator attention fast enough to matter.
- Ask (operator): same repair as the 2026-10-01 18:1xZ entry, now severely
  overdue. Two independent ledgers/journals have been forecasting, betting,
  and retro-ing against different histories for almost 6 days; any
  cross-side calibration or category stats computed from only one side's
  journal are missing roughly half the settled evidence from this window.
  Given how large the merge has grown, the forecasts-union script from the
  2026-09-18/21 repairs (`phil-local-loop-setup` notes) should still work
  (forecasts union by id preferring settled rows) but the watch
  items/price-moves/schedule.json/playbook/proposals three-way merges will
  be much larger this time.

## 2026-10-05 09:1xZ - Andersson row still open, unchanged (LIGHT tick)

- Evidence: `e746d7e1ba99` (market 1193094) on Gamma at 09:1xZ: `closed=false`,
  `umaResolutionStatus` null, `endDate` 2026-09-14T03:59Z, outcomePrices
  Yes 0.805 / No 0.195. The CLOB book for the held No token is empty.
  The cause is the one above (resolve.py gates the void branch on `closed`).
- Ask (operator): same decision as the 2026-10-03 entries. Nothing new for
  the agent to do; the position stays open until that decision lands.

## 2026-10-05 16:53Z - forecast price recorded as bid only; skip label vs gap (LIGHT tick)

- Evidence: forecast `2f88c34c6f9a` (Digger, Rotten Tomatoes >= 51, market 5157641)
  recorded `best_bid_at_record` 0.80, `best_ask_at_record` null,
  `market_prob_at_record` 0.80, with est 0.92 and skip reason `market-agrees`.
  The 15:51Z cycle log describes the same market as "market-agrees 0.92".
  Settled Yes, Brier vs recorded 0.80 is 0.040 against 0.0064 for the estimate.
  See `journal/retros/RETRO-20261005-1653.md`.
- Cause (unverified): forecast recording takes the bid when the ask is null, so
  the scored "market" is not a mid on thin books. The 0.12 gap also sits under a
  `market-agrees` label, which implies the recorded price was not the one the
  cycle compared against.
- Ask (operator): check `core/forecast.py` for how `market_prob_at_record` is set
  when the ask is null, and whether the skip label is derived from the same price.
  One row is not a pattern; count how many `market-agrees` rows have a gap above
  0.05 before changing anything.

- **Status (DEEP-2026-09-30):** ENDORSED (operator, CYCLE.md). The diagnosis is right. The overriding rule lives in a 69KB schedule.json `_comment` and in a playbook whose default Read stops at line 2,000 of 7,100, so the rules that matter are the ones cycles miss. Both proposed wordings are minimal and correct. Interim agent-side restatement: playbook "DEEP-2026-09-30 rulings".

## DEEP-2026-09-30 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **NEW (operator, CI/core, strengthens the carried funnel-weld item):**
  2 of 7 FULL cycles on Sep 29 committed screener rows but no funnel row:
  41b031e (15:51Z cloud) and d43503c (18:35Z operator). cycles.log
  claimed "Funnel: screened 300" both times. The mechanical check is:
  a commit that appends >=1 row to journal/screener.jsonl must also
  append a row to strategy/funnel.jsonl. That fits core/validate.py or
  the ci.yml boundary step. Agent-side interim: the playbook ruling
  "Funnel row is not optional".
- **NEW (operator, core/counterfactual.py, low priority):** `reconcile`
  parses the hand-kept OVV table from strategy/playbook.md, which pins a
  134KB section in the file every FULL cycle reads. The mechanical
  `ledger` has superseded the table (today: hand -15.60u vs ledger
  +14.97u, a 21-trade gap that nobody acts on). Proposal: point
  `PLAYBOOK` at a frozen copy (e.g. strategy/playbook-archive.md, where
  the section would move) or retire `reconcile`. Once that lands, the
  deep retro can move the 134KB section out of the live file. Status:
  PROPOSED.
- Carried unchanged: refusal-row dBrier column, funnel-weld CI check,
  ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener quota vs two runners, per-fold
  dBrier column, real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism,
  wire-nonce 401, EOA gas top-up, mech delivery-size, lease writability,
  screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger,
  core/screen.py data-source escalation slot (conditional on the 10-06
  sweep test).

**Status:** relaxation fork NOT MET (15th). 2 bets settled (Canada GDP
WON +3.77, RBA LOST -5.00), 0 placed, 5 open. No reverts. Playbook
reading note and CF-arithmetic-to-retro rule added, 7 sections archived.

## DEEP-2026-10-01 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **Hourly proposals this window:** none filed since DEEP-2026-09-30.
- **STRENGTHENED (operator, CI/core): funnel-weld check.** This is the
  third instance in three days: f3bf184 (2026-10-01 04:25Z FULL, cloud)
  appended 300 screener rows, placed bet 50d06b8745c2, and committed no
  `strategy/funnel.jsonl` row. That follows 41b031e and d43503c on Sep
  29. The agent-side rule did not hold for even one day. It sat at
  playbook line ~7,090, and a reminder is now also in the top-of-file
  reading note. A prose rule has now failed 3 times in 3 days, so the
  mechanical check (a commit that appends to journal/screener.jsonl
  must append to strategy/funnel.jsonl, in core/validate.py or the
  ci.yml boundary step) is the fix. The deep retro backfilled the
  missing row, flagged `backfilled_by`. Status: PROPOSED (priority
  raised).
- Carried unchanged: counterfactual.py `reconcile` repoint/retire,
  refusal-row dBrier column, ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener
  quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier column, real-twin
  allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce 401, EOA gas
  top-up, mech delivery-size, lease writability, screener quota refund,
  watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger, core/screen.py
  data-source escalation slot. That last item is now unconditional: the
  10-06 sweep test was met by USGS bet 9a2944acc280.

**Status:** 4 bets settled this window, all WON (PCE No, Parcl
NYC/Chicago/LA, +$3.72 total). 2 placed (USGS '7' Yes, Peterbilt
'Manufacturing' Yes), 3 open. No reverts. One funnel row backfilled.
Relaxation fork NOT MET (16th). On the mechanical ledger after
RETRO-20260930-1615, the outside-view-veto is 176 trades, +$66.20, and
dBrier +0.0343, so the vetoed estimates are still worse than the
market on Brier. I did not recompute fold pnl.

## DEEP-2026-10-02 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **Hourly proposals this window:** none filed since DEEP-2026-10-01.
- **Funnel-weld CI check:** the agent-side rule held on 4/4 FULLs today
  (08:25Z, 14:40Z, 20:15Z, 02:15Z), after 3 misses in the 3 days
  before. Status: PROPOSED (priority lowered; still worth having as a
  backstop).
- **NEW (operator, routine cadence, informational):** the cloud routine
  fires about every 2h with a few minutes of jitter, not hourly as
  CLAUDE.md says. That jitter turned 4 intended FULLs into LIGHTs in
  24h. The agent-side fix is in schedule.json, but if the hourly
  cadence is intended, the trigger may be throttled. Status:
  INFORMATIONAL.
- Carried unchanged: counterfactual.py `reconcile` repoint/retire,
  refusal-row dBrier column, ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener
  quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier column, real-twin
  allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce 401, EOA gas
  top-up, mech delivery-size, lease writability (every cloud LIGHT tick
  today logged "push refused, proceeding unprotected"), screener quota
  refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger, core/screen.py
  data-source escalation slot.

**Status:** 1 bet settled (Peterbilt 'Manufacturing' Yes WON +$1.10),
0 placed, 2 open. No reverts. Pacing tolerance rule added and 13
settled watch items archived. Relaxation fork NOT MET (17th; OVV
bucket dBrier +0.042 at n=157).

## DEEP-2026-10-03 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **Hourly proposals this window:** none filed since DEEP-2026-10-02.
- **Pre-registered agent-side decision (not an operator ask):** Parcl
  Dec31 (b), the freshly-seeded-ladder carve-out to max_spread. Status:
  REJECTED (see playbook 'DEEP-2026-10-03 rulings').
- **Cloud lease writability (carried).** It recurred on a FULL that placed
  a bet. The 2026-10-02 22:18Z cycle logged "lease not written: push of
  custom ref refused" and then placed 3989eabf623a unprotected. No
  duplicate placement happened, so the risk is still theoretical.
  Status: ENDORSED (operator act), priority unchanged.
- **Routine cadence (informational, carried).** The cloud trigger fires
  about every 2h. With the +1h45m target every tick is now a FULL (12 in
  24h, quota 45/150 at 04:4xZ), so the jitter no longer costs cycles.
  Status: INFORMATIONAL. No action needed unless hourly is intended.
- **Funnel-weld CI check:** agent-side rule held 12/12 FULLs. Status:
  PROPOSED (low priority backstop).
- Carried unchanged: counterfactual.py `reconcile` repoint/retire,
  refusal-row dBrier column, ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener
  quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier column, real-twin
  allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce 401, EOA gas
  top-up, mech delivery-size, screener quota refund, watch.py shape
  regexes, subclass auto-tagger, core/screen.py data-source escalation
  slot.

**Status:** 0 bets settled, 2 placed (both audited compliant, KEEP), 4
open. No reverts. Relaxation fork NOT MET (18th; OVV mechanical
ledger 201 rows, +$116.61, dBrier +0.0333).

## DEEP-2026-10-04 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **Hourly proposals this window:** none filed since DEEP-2026-10-03.
- **NEW (operator, low priority): cycles.log marker in a fixed field.**
  The pacing guardrail's grep has now needed a new version four times
  (v1-v5) because the hourly agent writes the FULL/LIGHT marker as free
  text. Proposal: CYCLE.md specifies the `cycle done:` line format
  exactly, e.g. `<ts> cycle done: [FULL|LIGHT|TRIGGERED] ...`, or
  core/ writes a structured `tick_type` field to cycles.log or
  funnel.jsonl that the count reads. Evidence: v4 printed 1 vs a true 10
  on 2026-10-04 (playbook DEEP-2026-10-04 rulings). Status: PROPOSED.
- Carried unchanged: cloud lease writability (ENDORSED), routine cadence
  (INFORMATIONAL), funnel-weld CI check (PROPOSED), counterfactual.py
  `reconcile`, refusal-row dBrier column, ODDS_API_KEY on both runners,
  screener quota vs two runners, per-fold dBrier column, real-twin
  allowed-classes, settled_ts determinism, wire-nonce 401, EOA gas
  top-up, mech delivery-size, screener quota refund, watch.py shape
  regexes, subclass auto-tagger, core/screen.py data-source escalation
  slot.

**Status:** 0 bets settled, 1 placed (b05a47dabf33 Lula <44%), graded a
METHOD VIOLATION (price inside the model range, unsourced sd). The
position stands because only core writes the ledger. No reverts of
hourly edits. Relaxation fork NOT MET (19th; no OVV settlements beyond
the HITS row already tabled).

## DEEP-2026-10-05 - deep-retro proposals and status

- **Hourly proposals this window:** none filed since DEEP-2026-10-04.
- **Funnel-weld CI check (PROPOSED, carried): new evidence, priority
  raised.** On 2026-10-04, cycles.log has 8 FULL lines and
  strategy/funnel.jsonl has 4 cloud rows. The 06:35, 08:18, 10:17 and
  22:24Z FULLs screened 280-300 markets each but wrote no row.
  core/screen_value.py consumes these rows. A CI or core check that
  fails a cycle commit whose cycles.log line says FULL or TRIGGERED
  without a same-timestamp funnel row would stop the drift. The playbook
  rule (DEEP-2026-10-05) is the agent-side mitigation only. Status:
  PROPOSED.
- **cycles.log fixed tick_type field (PROPOSED, DEEP-2026-10-04):**
  reinforced. Pacing count v5 now also counts TRIGGERED lines as FULL
  (7 vs a true 6+1).
- Carried unchanged: cloud lease writability (ENDORSED; the push of
  the lease ref was still refused at 10-04 06:35Z and later), routine
  cadence (INFORMATIONAL), counterfactual.py `reconcile`, refusal-row
  dBrier column, ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, screener quota vs two
  runners, per-fold dBrier column, real-twin allowed-classes, settled_ts
  determinism, wire-nonce 401, EOA gas top-up, mech delivery-size,
  screener quota refund, watch.py shape regexes, subclass auto-tagger,
  core/screen.py data-source escalation slot.

**Status:** 0 bets settled (2 awaiting UMA on near-certain losses:
b05a47dabf33, 9a2944acc280). No reverts of hourly edits. Relaxation fork not
re-evaluated in full today. Its only new input is b350, an OVV row where
the veto avoided a CF -$5.00, so the input points away from relaxation:
NOT MET (20th).

## DEEP-2026-10-06 - deep-retro proposals and status

Hourly entries filed since DEEP-2026-10-05:

- **Main fork (entries 2026-10-01 18:1xZ, 10-02 02:5xZ, 10-02 06:0xZ,
  10-05 02:5xZ): RESOLVED.** The operator merged it in 409a6ad (2026-10-05
  22:24Z, 126 local / 142 remote commits). This session started shallow
  (HEAD 6dcd45c). After `fetch --unshallow`, local and origin/main were
  identical (0/0), so there was no divergence.
- **Void branch unreachable (2026-10-03, 10-03 06:40Z) and Andersson row
  still open (10-05 09:1xZ): REJECTED as a void; position stays open.**
  The diagnosis is right: resolve.py returns before the 48h void when
  gamma says `closed: false`. But the remedy would score wrongly here.
  e746d7e1ba99 is open because its event (the next PM taking office) has
  not happened. The market's end date was nominal, and the book is live
  (mid 0.195, MTM -$0.36). Voiding at pnl 0 would delete a position the
  market is actively pricing, and on other rows it would turn marked
  losses into zeros. That flatters a record already at z -3.48. A void
  should apply only when gamma or UMA marks a market cancelled or
  invalid. Narrower ask (operator): have score.py `open_mtm` flag rows
  more than 14 days past end_date, so they stay visible without being
  settled.
- **Forecast price recorded as bid when the ask is null (10-05 16:53Z):
  ENDORSED, low priority.** It affects 17 of 1,687 rows (all of them
  record market = bid). Only 1 of the 12 market-agrees rows with a gap
  above 0.05 is one of them. Ask (operator, core/forecast.py): when the
  ask is null, record `market_prob_at_record` as null, or as the last
  trade with a flag, and have score.py exclude those rows from forecast
  dBrier.
- **Counterfactual reconcile backlog (10-01 08:3xZ): RESOLVED.** The
  hourly backfill landed at 2026-10-06 02:11Z. It is superseded by
  today's retirement of the hand table as a per-settlement duty
  (playbook DEEP-2026-10-06).
- **Subclass auto-tagger window bleed (09-30 22:1xZ): carried,
  PROPOSED.**

New operator proposals (DEEP-2026-10-06):

- **P1: let the frozen hand table leave playbook.md (core/counterfactual.py).**
  playbook.md is 527KB / 8,382 lines. The section "Outside-view veto:
  settled counterfactual ledger" alone is about 2,430 lines, and
  `reconcile` hard-codes `PLAYBOOK` plus that section header, exiting
  if it is missing. So the agent cannot archive the table without
  breaking a core tool. Ask: make reconcile read
  `strategy/archive/counterfactual-hand-table.md` when it exists, or
  drop reconcile now that the hand table is retired. Then the next deep
  retro moves the table out. A further ask: a CYCLE.md sentence that
  playbook.md is read by section (grep the headers), not end to end.
  The file is far past a cycle's reading budget. The DEEP-2026-09-30
  status already noted that the default Read stops at line 2,000.
- **P2: two runners overspent the shared screener quota on 2026-10-05.**
  funnel.jsonl 23:11Z (operator) records 195/150 batches (cloud 120,
  operator 75). Cloud and operator cycles also ran 3 minutes apart
  (cycles 20261005-2212 operator and 20261005-2215 cloud). That is the
  same no-lease condition that produced the 09-29 fork, so the fork
  can come back. Ask: enforce the runner lease (the cloud-lease
  writability item, ENDORSED since 09-18), or give each runner its own
  quota share.
- Carried unchanged: funnel-weld CI check (PROPOSED, priority raised
  10-05; every cloud FULL since then has a row. Operator-side rows exist
  for 10-05 10:17/15:50/19:04/23:11Z, but whether the 13:38Z and 22:12Z
  operator lines were FULLs cannot be told without a tick_type field, which
  is the next item), cycles.log tick_type field, refusal-row dBrier column,
  ODDS_API_KEY on both runners, per-fold dBrier column (the deep retro
  computes it by hand again today), real-twin allowed classes,
  wire-nonce 401, EOA gas top-up, mech delivery size, screener quota
  refund, watch.py shape regexes, core/screen.py data-source slot.

**Status:** 0 bets settled, 0 placed (about 48h without a placement,
audited: the gates working, not avoidance). Relaxation fork NOT MET
(21st; f3 +0.050 / f4 +0.006). No reverts of hourly edits.
risk.json notes compacted from 27KB to 2KB, and 3 closed
schedule.json watch items pruned (19.7KB).

## 2026-10-07 04:45Z — operator machine is geo-blocked from gamma (HTTP 451)

**Symptom.** On the 04:42Z FULL (operator machine, lease acquired and
written), `core/resolve.py` got `HTTP Error 451: Unavailable For Legal
Reasons` on every gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets/<id> fetch: 47 of 47
before the 10-minute tool timeout, 3 retries each. The open ledger rows
(1193094 Sweden PM, 4424387 RBI, 5194672 Parcl NYC, 5204549 USGS) were
among them. No prior 451 appears anywhere in journal/. Cloud cycles
through 02:14Z read gamma normally, so this is this machine's egress (a
VPN or region change), not Polymarket-wide.

**Consequences.** Nothing settles from this runner. scan.py has no pool,
so no screen and no research quotes. ledger.py place has no book. A FULL
on this runner degenerates into retro-only. A resolve pass takes over 10
minutes of retries and still settles nothing. The lease is held that
whole time, so the cloud runner is demoted to LIGHT for no gain.

**Asks (operator).** (1) Restore this machine's route to Polymarket
(VPN/region) before the next `./loop.sh` run, and before any `--real`
run, since real.py's order path presumably shares the same egress. (2)
Have loop.sh preflight one gamma GET. On 451/403, either skip the run or
run it LIGHT without taking the lease, so the cloud runner keeps the
FULL slot. (3) Optionally, make resolve.py fail fast after N consecutive
451s rather than retrying every market 3 times.
